<h2>Proper use of letter-spacing</h2>
<p class="tooMuch">For people could close their eyes to greatness, to horrors, to beauty, and their ears to melodies or deceiving words. But they couldn't escape scent.<p>
<p>And scent entered into their very core, went directly to their hearts, and decided for good and all between affection and contempt, disgust and lust, love and hate. <br />He who ruled scent ruled the hearts of men.</p>
