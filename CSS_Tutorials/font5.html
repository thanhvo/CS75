<p>For people could close their eyes to greatness, to horrors, to beauty, and their ears to melodies or deceiving words. <span class="bolderText">But they couldn't escape scent</span>.</p>
<p >And scent entered into their very core, went directly to their hearts, and decided for good and all between affection and contempt, disgust and lust, love and hate. </p>
<p><span class="bolderText">He who ruled scent ruled the hearts of men</span>.</p>
