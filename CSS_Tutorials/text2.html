<h3>Breaking news - I'm centered!</h3>
<p>For people could close their eyes to greatness, to horrors, to beauty, and their ears to melodies or deceiving words. But they couldn't escape scent.</p>
<p>And scent entered into their very core, went directly to their hearts, and decided for good and all between affection and contempt, disgust and lust, love and hate. 
He who ruled scent ruled the hearts of men.</p>
