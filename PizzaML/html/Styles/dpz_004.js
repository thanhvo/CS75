From there, every pizza is customizable to customer preferences. Select from five crusts &mdash; Hand Tossed, Handmade Pan, Brooklyn Style, Crunchy Thin, and Gluten Free &mdash; and a variety of sauces, toppings, and cheese.

In fact, we are always interested in what our customers think about our menu, which is why more than 70 percent of items are new since 2008.</p> <p>Did you know that the creation of our &ldquo;inspired pizza&rdquo; recipe in 2009 was aided by the thousands of messages we received directly from consumers responding via social media? Here are a few other examples where we used customer feedback to fuel ideas:</p> <ul> <li>When we introduced our Boneless Chicken Wings in 2011, we did so with the intent to provide customers with even more ways to customize their favorite menu items, and we openly welcomed customer feedback.</li> <li>The idea for Parmesan Bread Bites originated in the Domino&#x2019;s kitchen of franchise owner Brian Elder in 2011.</li> <li>Domino&#x2019;s was the first national pizza delivery chain to offer gluten-free crust when we launched it in May 2012.</li> <li>And in response to customer demand for a handmade pizza crust with a buttery taste, we debuted the Handmade Pan Pizza in 2012.</li> </ul> <p>At Domino&#x2019;s, customer feedback is a part of our business.

When it comes to making and delivering delicious pizza, Domino’s is king. Domino’s operates more than 14,000 <a href="./pizza-restaurant/">pizza restaurants</a> in more than 85 countries, and delivers more than 1.5 million pizzas each day. Domino’s delivery experts drive more than 10 million miles across the United States every week to bring you the best food we can make. Talk about passion! Here’s how we became a powerhouse of pizza delivery.</p> <h2> All About Pizza Domination</h2> <p>From humble beginnings as a single pizza <a href="./pizza-restaurant/">restaurant in 1960</a>, Domino&#x2019;s has become today&#x2019;s recognized world leader in pizza delivery. At Domino&#x2019;s we&#x2019;re all about pizza &mdash; and from the day our doors opened, we have dedicated ourselves to making and delivering delicious food with high-quality ingredients. Beyond pioneering the concept of efficiently delivering our made-to-order pizzas, we have been a part of innovations that have made a significant impact on the entire food delivery industry:</p> <ul> <li>Domino&#x2019;s pioneered patented insulating bags to keep pizzas oven-hot during normal delivery.</li> <li>Domino&#x2019;s created the sturdy corrugated pizza box, which keeps moisture from weakening the box and cheese from sticking to the top.</li> <li>Domino&#x2019;s invented the 3D car-top sign, which is currently used by a variety of industries, including taxis and driving schools.</li> </ul> <p>We&#x2019;re all about delivery ideas that make it easier and more convenient for our customers. When you think about <a href="./pizza-places/">pizza places</a> that have delivered hot and fresh from the oven to your door, think Domino&#x2019;s, because we&#x2019;re constantly updating our <a href="./about-menu/">menu</a> to include more <a href="../pages/order/menu.jsp#/menu/category/entrees/">entrees</a>, <a href="../pages/order/menu.jsp#/menu/category/sides/">sides</a>, and <a href="../pages/order/menu.jsp#/menu/category/desserts/">desserts</a> created just for you.</p> <h3> Beyond Pizza Delivery</h3> <p>Want to know more about pizza? Domino&#x2019;s launched <a href="./online-delivery/">online pizza ordering</a> in 2007, and in 2008, we revolutionized the online delivery experience by introducing the Pizza Builder and <a href="../pages/tracker/#/track/order/">Domino&#x2019;s Tracker</a><sup>&reg;</sup> tools.</p> <p>We&#x2019;re all about pizza, as well as harnessing the power of technology to make your ordering experience even better. So we identified key ways our customers would benefit from online tools. Pizza Builder, an innovation in <a href="./food-online/">online food ordering</a>, enables customers to make their favorite selections and see their pizza come to life on a computer screen. Domino&#x2019;s Tracker<sup>&reg;</sup> is an innovation in <a href="./food-delivery/">food delivery</a> that enables customers to follow the progress of their order from the time it&#x2019;s placed until it arrives at the door. We also added the <a href="../pages/customer/#/customer/profile/">Pizza Profile</a> to the website, as well as <a href="http://anyware.dominos.com/">Domino&#x2019;s AnyWare</a>&trade; ordering technologies, which enable customers to leverage technology to place their order via text, smartphone, tweet, and more. Finally, because we&#x2019;re all about savings, we also added <a href="../pages/order/coupon.jsp#/coupon/national/">coupons</a> and promos to the website.</p> <p>Domino&#x2019;s innovations help us better deliver on our promise to bring customers great pizzas, pasta, sandwiches, desserts, and <a href="../pages/order/menu.jsp#/menu/category/drinks/">drinks</a> as efficiently as possible.</p> <div class="clear"></div> </div> </div> \x3c!-- SET SOCIAL --\x3e <div id="deals"> <div id="news"> <div id="reviews"></div> </div> <div id="local"> <div id="signup"></div> <div id="sitemap"> <a href="'+f(a.lambda(null!=b?b.ctx:b,b))+'/about-pizza/sitemap/">Sitemap</a> </div> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- END SOCIAL --\x3e <div class="clear"></div> </div> </div> </div> \x3c!-- END MAIN --\x3e </div> \x3c!-- END PAGE --\x3e </div> '},useData:!0}),this.overrides.alfredosauce=a.template({compiler:[7,">= 4.0.0"],main:function(a,b,c,d,e){var f=a.escapeExpression;return'<div id="coupons"> \x3c!-- SET PAGE --\x3e <div id="delivery"> \x3c!-- SET MAIN --\x3e <div id="order"> <div class="locations"> <div class="pizza"> '+f(c.prt.call(null!=b?b:a.nullContext||{},"aboutPizzaPageOrder",{name:"prt",hash:{},data:e}))+' <div id="online" class="head"> <div class="dominos"> <h1>Who Delivers Pasta With Alfredo Sauce Near Me?</h1> <p>No matter what your favorite pasta or pizza might be, Domino&#x2019;s is the <a href="../../../pizza-places/">pizza place</a> with the Alfredo sauce that is sure to liven it up with its earthy and rich flavor profile. For each and every pasta dish we make for you, we pride ourselves on never compromising our high standard of ingredients, overall quality, and taste. Just find your nearest Domino&#x2019;s location online, and you&#x2019;ll be on your way to enjoying our pizzas and pastas customized with just the right amount of Alfredo sauce to satisfying your craving.</p> <h2>What Makes Alfredo Sauce So Delicious?</h2> <p>When it comes to pasta sauces, Alfredo sauce is an undisputed favorite among Italian food fans. The nutty, savory flavor of Parmesan cheese is dramatically enhanced by the richness of butter in this sauce. It&#x2019;s is also one of the more adaptable sauces in Italian cuisine, and Domino&#x2019;s spent years perfecting its signature recipe. Our goal was to make an Alfredo sauce that complemented the ingredients in Domino&#x2019;s pasta offerings but never overpowered the other elements of the dish. After years of experimentation, we finally created what we consider to be a sauce that is perfectly balanced &mdash; and it&#x2019;s great not just on pasta but also on pizza.</p> <h3>An Alfredo Sauce Dish for Every Appetite</h3> <p>One of the neat things about this sauce is how adaptable it can be. Maybe you&#x2019;re craving something a little on the heartier side? How about a heaping helping of perfectly tender penne pasta and white meat chicken tossed in Alfredo sauce? Domino&#x2019;s Chicken Alfredo pasta, available as a standalone dish or paired with our oven-baked bread bowl, is just the dish you are looking for. (You can use that bread bowl to devour every last drop of the tasty sauce.) Diners craving a <a href="../../../vegetarian/">vegetarian</a> option should try Domino&#x2019;s Pasta Primavera a succulent combination of fresh spinach, diced tomatoes, fresh mushrooms and fresh onions, mixed with penne pasta tossed in Alfredo sauce. What&#x2019;s more, at Domino&#x2019;s, you can get Alfredo on a pizza &mdash; by itself or combined with tomato-based pizza sauce. Just choose the Build Your Own pizza option when you order and ask for it.</p> <h4>Alfredo Sauce Makes Any Dish Delish</h4> <p>From the moment that you <a href="../../../online-pizza/">order</a> one of our specialty pizzas, oven-baked sandwiches, pasta bowls, boneless chicken, or any other Domino&#x2019;s favorite, we are committed to bringing you the most delicious dish possible in a timely manner.

But there are still a lot of ways to enjoy this meat the way it was meant to be tasted. In fact, we think the best way to enjoy the meat is on a Domino&#x2019;s <a href="../../../">pizza</a>, where its salty, crunchy, one-of-a-kind goodness lifts already-delicious ingredients to new heights.</p> <h2> Dear Bacon, You&#x2019;re Perfect</h2> <p>Although the meat has a wonderfully distinct flavor, it&#x2019;s versatile and blends equally well with sweet (pineapple), spicy (hot sauce), bold (beef and cheddar), and savory (spinach and feta) foods. That&#x2019;s what makes it a brilliant pizza topping. At a Domino&#x2019;s <a href="../../../pizza-restaurant/">Pizza restaurant</a>, there&#x2019;s a combination for every pizza preference.</p> <h3>Endless Bacon-Abilities</h3> <p>Domino&#x2019;s is the pizza place, if you&#x2019;re looking for a really great pizza? Try our Cali Chicken Bacon Ranch. This popular pizza pairs the subtle flavor of bacon with our garlic Parmesan white sauce, grilled chicken breast, tomatoes, and 100 percent real mozzarella and provolone on a cheesy provolone crust.</p> <p>Another tried-and-true favorite is our Honolulu Hawaiian pizza, which combines bacon, ham, pineapple, roasted peppers and 100 percent real mozzarella cheese for a crowd-pleasing take on an American tradition.</p> <h4>Create a Bacon Original</h4> <p>Anyone who has doubts about bacon as a pizza topping should begin by swapping it in for pepperoni, while adding toppings like green olives and mushrooms. When building a pizza, consider how the meat is used in other dishes. What might be added to an omelet besides cheese? Peppers, spinach, tomatoes, ham, mushrooms, and onions. Or create a pizza twist on the traditional BLT by combining bacon with our smooth Alfredo sauce, spinach, and tomatoes. You could also mimic a rich pasta dish by pairing the meat with our hearty marinara sauce, spinach, onions, and mushrooms. The result will be a harmonious medley of flavor.</p> <p>You don&#x2019;t need Christmas tree ornaments or Mr. Bacon dancing on your car dashboard to show your love for this favorite meat.

Sometimes confused with its much spicier cousin, the Hungarian wax pepper, this pepper actually has very little heat (it&#x2019;s five times milder than a jalape&ntilde;o). For this reason, it imbues pizza with a subtle, sweet, distinctive spice. When you&#x2019;re craving pizza with banana peppers, we&#x2019;ve got you covered.</p> <h2>Perfect Pepper Pizza Pairings</h2> <p>We use banana peppers that have been pickled in white vinegar, a popular treatment that highlights the natural tanginess of the peppers and makes them sweeter and less spicy than when they are in their raw form.</p> <p>If you are new to these peppers as pizza topping, try using them in place of bell peppers for an ever-so-slight whisper of heat. Or use them on pizza to introduce children to new foods. Who can say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to <a href="/en/about-pizza/">pizza</a>?</p> <p>We can&#x2019;t resist their cheerful color on nearly any pizza, but some of our favorites include the following combinations:<br> <ul> <li>Create a yin and yang pizza by starting with BBQ sauce, then adding bacon, fresh green peppers, and banana peppers. The sweet sauce pairs well with the sweet pepper, while the hint of heat complements the smoky bacon.</li> <li>Make a pizza that mimics an Italian sub by pairing our hearty marinara sauce with pepperoni, salami, and ham, and finishing it off with fresh green peppers, fresh onions, banana peppers, and provolone cheese.</li> <li>Harness the flavors of the Mediterranean by combining our garlic Parmesan white sauce with roasted red peppers, diced tomatoes, fresh spinach, fresh onions, and banana peppers, plus feta, provolone, and American cheese.</li> <li>Banana peppers are often included in antipasto platters, which is a great source of pizza inspiration. Pair them with our robust tomato sauce, black and green olives, salami, and shredded Parmesan cheese to recreate the classic Italian appetizer as a distinctive pizza.</li> <li>Some pizza devotees have been known to add banana peppers to our Honolulu Hawaiian pizza, creating a delicate balance between sweet and spicy with sliced ham, smoked bacon, pineapple, and roasted red peppers.</li> </ul> </p> <p>These delicious little peppers may never make America&#x2019;s top 10 list of pizza toppings, and that&#x2019;s too bad.

To create our Memphis BBQ Chicken pizza, we use only premium grilled <a href="/en/pages/order/#/section/Food/category/Wings/">chicken</a>, crunchy fresh onions, and not one, not two, but three cheeses: mozzarella, provolone and cheddar on our hand-tossed crust. The result is a traditional summer cookout treat in <a href="/en/about-pizza/">one perfect pizza</a>. Whenever you&#x2019;re thinking BBQ, don&#x2019;t be afraid to think <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-places/">pizza place</a>. In fact, our Memphis BBQ Chicken pizza is a great way to beat back winter blues when you&#x2019;re longing for the carefree living of warmer months.</p> <h2>Order Outside the Box With BBQ Chicken Pizza</h2> <p>Pizza may have originated in Italy, but the idea to create pizza with nontraditional toppings &mdash; like BBQ Chicken &mdash; was born in California. Although derided by some pizza purists, the so-called &ldquo;California Pizza&rdquo; movement took firm hold in the 1980s and has refused to let go.</p> <h3>Memphis BBQ Chicken: the Pride of Regional Barbecue</h3> <p>It was with this inventive spirit that we created our <a href="/en/pages/order/menu.jsp#/menu/category/viewAll/">Memphis BBQ Chicken</a> pizza. Although the origin of BBQ (or barbecue) sauce is a matter of some debate, there&#x2019;s no doubt Americans take their regional BBQ styles very seriously. The hallmark of Memphis BBQ Chicken is its tangy, tomato-based sauce made with white vinegar and sweet molasses.</p> <h3>Please a Crowd With BBQ Chicken</h3> <p>There&#x2019;s a reason BBQ Chicken is a summer picnic staple: It&#x2019;s hugely popular. Add it to your next pizza party for the same ecstatic results. The Memphis BBQ Chicken pizza is a good choice for guests who don&#x2019;t eat red meat, and kids will also enjoy the novelty of a new sauce on their pizzas.</p> <h4>The Yin and Yang of BBQ Chicken</h4> <p>The Memphis BBQ Chicken pizza can stand on its own, but for some, it&#x2019;s just a starting point. Add additional toppings like jalape&ntilde;os or banana peppers, which have a spicy kick that counterbalances the sweet BBQ Chicken.</p> <p>Let the pizza traditionalists scoff. We&#x2019;re too busy enjoying our Memphis BBQ Chicken pizza to pay them any mind.

Think: pizza, chicken wings, and more.</p> <h2>Some Dishes Just Demand Barbecue Flavor</h2> <p>On our <a href="/en/about-pizza/about-menu/">Memphis BBQ Chicken pizza</a>, mozzarella, provolone, and cheddar cheeses, along with perfectly cooked pieces of white meat chicken, meet tangy and zesty BBQ sauce head-on. It&#x2019;s a flavor punch sure to satisfy all your barbecue cravings.</p> <p>That same smoky barbecue goodness is also available in other popular dishes.

For those who relish spice, however, beef counterbalances the heat of jalape&ntilde;o peppers and hot sauce. And, because it&#x2019;s mild, beef plays well with others, pairing perfectly with a wide variety of ingredients.

When paired with beef, pepperoni, and sausage, they are like the comma in a meat sentence, a brief respite for the taste buds. Sprinkled over a pizza of spinach, tomato, and feta cheese, they reflect their Mediterranean heritage, conjuring images of the sun-drenched fields where they grew to ripe perfection. You can&#x2019;t go wrong adding black olives to just about any Domino&#x2019;s pizza. Looking for a <a href="/en/about-pizza/vegetarian/">pizza place</a> to quench your olive craving? Domino&#x2019;s delivers!</p> <h2>Pizza Inspired by the Mediterranean</h2> <p>In their raw form, black olives are as bitter as day-old coffee grounds. It must have been a very optimistic individual who first tasted an olive from the tree and thought, &ldquo;All this fruit needs is some brining and curing to make it fabulous.&rdquo; Today, black olives are served alongside brown and green olives in <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-restaurant/">trattorias</a> throughout the Mediterranean. In fact, they are perhaps best known as part of tapas, a variety of small savory dishes often served as a snack with drinks.</p> <p>For those who have never added black olives to <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-delivery/">pizza</a>, tapas ingredients are an inspiring guide to creating harmonious combinations. Pair them with our hearty marinara sauce, green olives, and Parmesan, provolone, and feta cheeses, then add a variety of meats, like salami and sliced Italian sausage, for a pizza that reads like a traditional tapas <a href="/en/pages/order/menu.jsp#/menu/category/viewAll/">menu</a>.</p> <p>Let the Mediterranean origins of the fruit guide you to further flavor explorations, like a pizza that combines our Robust Inspired tomato sauce with black olives and mozzarella cheese. Simple, fresh ingredients prepared simply are a hallmark of Mediterranean cooking.</p> <h3>Common Combinations</h3> <p>Another common use of black olives is in a spread with cream cheese and garlic served on crackers. The simple appetizer translates deliciously to a pizza: Start with our garlic Parmesan white sauce, add black olives and cheeses, and get creative with other toppings of your choice. Jalape&ntilde;os, anyone?</p> <p>Black olives are a natural topping for any pizza made with tomato sauce, as they are often added to pasta sauces to balance acidity and add a nice texture. Because of their mellow flavor, they are also a favorite with kids, who may be more willing to try new flavors when introduced on a favorite pizza.</p> <p>When experimenting with this fruit as a pizza topping, remember that they have the ability to soak in surrounding flavors, magnifying the other toppings. This makes for a more delicious pizza experience.</p> <h4>Ready to Order?</h4> <p><a href="/en/pages/order/#/locations/search/">Domino&#x2019;s delivers</a> pizza and more.

Though it may be true, those who have acquired the taste may think that it&#x2019;s the most delicious cheese out there (or at least it&#x2019;s in the top five). The fact that this cheese was adapted into a dressing is worthy of cheers, and Domino&#x2019;s has perfected Blue Cheese by turning it into a dipping sauce. Domino&#x2019;s Blue Cheese sauce is creamy and a bit tangy, with a savory finish.</p> <h2>Blue Cheese Sauce With Chicken Wings and Sandwiches</h2> <p>Domino&#x2019;s Blue Cheese sauce adds zing to <a href="/en/pages/order/#/section/Food/category/Wings/">chicken wings</a> where ranch falls short, and the creaminess helps tone down spiciness without overpowering it. Domino&#x2019;s chicken wings basted with hot or BBQ sauce are the perfect companions for the sauce. If you prefer Blue Cheese sauce over ranch, take those Crispy Bacon &amp; Tomato Specialty Chicken pieces and dip them into the sharp and savory goodness. Try pairing the sauce with the Chicken Bacon Ranch sandwich for something extra special. It&#x2019;s also perfect for giving a little punch to a Mediterranean Veggie Sub.</p> <h3>Blue Cheese Sauce Adds Zing to Your Pizza</h3> <p>Try dipping our Buffalo Chicken pizza in this delicious sauce for a chicken wing experience in pizza form. The Memphis BBQ Chicken is also a great choice for dipping with our Blue Cheese sauce. If you prefer to create your own pizza perfect for dipping, we recommend a chicken and bacon combination with your favorite <a href="/en/about-pizza/options/topping/veggie">veggie</a> toppings. The possibilities are nearly endless, so tap into your creative side.</p> <h4>Order Domino&#x2019;s Pizza and Blue Cheese Sauce Now</h4> <p>If you&#x2019;re in the mood for hot, delicious pizza, pasta, oven-baked sandwiches, and desserts, order Domino&#x2019;s for delivery or carryout.

Buffalo sauce, named for Buffalo, New York, where it was invented, is a combination of hot sauce and melted butter (which explains why it tastes so good).</p> <p>Enjoying a Buffalo Chicken pizza is like digging into a large order of buffalo chicken <a href="/en/pages/order/#/section/Food/category/Wings/">wings</a>, minus the mess. What&#x2019;s more, for those who love the spicy sweetness of buffalo sauce, but not necessarily chicken wings, Domino&#x2019;s Buffalo Chicken pizza is the perfect way to enjoy the best of both worlds. You better believe this pizza place knows how to get your Buffalo Chicken pizza just right.</p> <h2>Buffalo Chicken Has Just the Right Spice</h2> <p>Our Buffalo Chicken pizza is prepared with premium grilled chicken doused with a liberal amount of traditional buffalo sauce, which has a sour kick and a spicy aftertaste that tingles with vinegar flavor. The sweet and spicy taste of buffalo chicken lingers, pairing perfectly with the refreshing crunch of fresh onions and the richness of provolone cheese.</p> <h3>Make Your Buffalo Chicken Experience Unique</h3> <p>A great way to enjoy our Buffalo Chicken pizza is with a side of blue cheese or ranch sauce, which is how the original buffalo chicken was served in New York. Or build on our Buffalo Chicken pizza to create an original pizza masterpiece by adding toppings like banana peppers or bacon, which complement the tanginess of buffalo chicken.</p> <h4>Add Heat to Buffalo Chicken</h4> <p>Spice seekers can up the fiery ante of their Buffalo Chicken pizza by adding more layers of heat with jalape&ntilde;os and hot sauce. For those who love the taste of buffalo sauce but prefer a milder flavor profile, the spiciness of buffalo chicken can easily be tamed by extra cheese, and its sweetness can be accentuated with the addition of pineapple and tomatoes.</p> <p>Buffalo Chicken pizza is a great choice for <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-party/">parties</a>, <a href="/en/about-pizza/lunch-ideas/">office lunches</a>, or family movie night. Adults and kids alike will love the chance to try a classic party food in pizza form, where the unmistakable flavor of buffalo chicken meets its cheesy match.</p> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- SET SOCIAL --\x3e <div id="deals"> <div id="news"> <div id="reviews"></div> </div> <div id="local"> <div id="signup"></div> <div id="sitemap"> <a href="'+f(a.lambda(null!=b?b.ctx:b,b))+'/about-pizza/sitemap/">Sitemap</a> </div> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- END SOCIAL --\x3e <div class="clear"></div> </div> </div> </div> \x3c!-- END MAIN --\x3e </div> \x3c!-- END PAGE --\x3e </div> '},useData:!0}),this.overrides.calOMeter=a.template({compiler:[7,">= 4.0.0"],main:function(a,b,c,d,e){return' <div id="js-nutritionCalculatorContent" class="nutrition-content grid"> <div class="grid__cell--1"> <h1 class="pageHeading">May We Recommend</h1> <p> Wouldn\'t it be nice if you could carry one of these around with you all day?

The degree to which the beef is chopped, the type of cheese used, and the toppings, however, spark heated debate among aficionados.</p> <p>Domino&#x2019;s <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-restaurant/">pizza restaurant</a> offers two ways to enjoy the classic flavor combination: as a toasty Oven-Baked Sandwich or on an inspired Specialty Pizza. Both are loaded with steak, cheese, onions, and green peppers.</p> <h2>Keepin&#x2019; It Real With Cheese Steak</h2> <p>Like the sandwich that originated in Philadelphia, our sandwich and pizza includes tender, succulent steak, a section of the beef tenderloin. Though some enthusiasts insist that only jarred cheese sauce should be used in creating the sandwich, others, including us, argue for the mild flavor and medium consistency of a blend of provolone and American cheeses.</p> <p>There is also debate over whether an authentic cheese steak should include anything other than beef, cheese, and saut&eacute;ed onions (which are optional). Both our Philly Cheese Steak sandwich and <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizzeria/">pizza</a> include fresh onions, green peppers, and mushrooms for a well-rounded balance of flavors. The bread for our sandwich is baked a beautiful golden brown, while the pizza consists of premium ingredients piled high.</p> <h3>Permission Granted to Customize Your Cheese Steak</h3> <p>With all due respect to the experts, we believe it&#x2019;s is a matter of personal taste, and both the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich and <a href="/en/pages/order/#/section/Food/category/Pizza/">pizza</a> are opportunities to take creative license. There&#x2019;s no judgment for adding toppings, including banana peppers, jalape&ntilde;os, diced tomatoes, black or green olives, hot sauce, bacon, Italian sausage, or pepperoni. All would be delicious additions, albeit ones that might make a purist&#x2019;s head spin.</p> <h4>Beyond the Cheese Steak Tradition</h4> <p>Pizza connoisseurs have already discovered the possibilities that Philly cheese steak provides. In addition to the traditional sandwich, a wonderful &mdash; and out of the ordinary &mdash; combination is Philly cheese steak with ranch, a great choice for those with gourmet tastes.</p> <p><a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-delivery/">Order your favorites from Domino&#x2019;s</a> <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-places/">pizza place</a> online anytime.</p> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- SET SOCIAL --\x3e <div id="deals"> <div id="news"> <div id="reviews"></div> </div> <div id="local"> <div id="signup"></div> <div id="sitemap"> <a href="'+f(a.lambda(null!=b?b.ctx:b,b))+'/about-pizza/sitemap/">Sitemap</a> </div> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- END SOCIAL --\x3e <div class="clear"></div> </div> </div> </div> \x3c!-- END MAIN --\x3e </div> \x3c!-- END PAGE --\x3e </div> '},useData:!0}),this.overrides.cheesybread=a.template({compiler:[7,">= 4.0.0"],main:function(a,b,c,d,e){var f=a.escapeExpression;return'<div id="coupons"> \x3c!-- SET PAGE --\x3e <div id="delivery"> \x3c!-- SET MAIN --\x3e <div id="order"> <div class="locations"> <div class="pizza"> '+f(c.prt.call(null!=b?b:a.nullContext||{},"aboutPizzaPageOrder",{name:"prt",hash:{},data:e}))+' <div id="online" class="head"> <div class="dominos"> <h1>Does Domino&#x2019;s Have Cheesy Bread?</h1> <p>As a side dish or a meal itself, Domino&#x2019;s oven-baked Stuffed Cheesy Bread satisfies with an exquisite cheese blend, hearty bread, and savory seasonings.

The following terms of use govern your use of the Card. By your purchase and/or use of the Card, you are agreeing to these terms and conditions as well as those provided on the back of each card and those provided by the Card issuer, CARDCO available <a href=\"http://dominos.cardcompliant.com\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Domino's GC Inc. and their respective parents, affiliates, successors and assigns are collectively referred to herein as \"Domino's Pizza.\" The Card can only be used at participating Domino's Pizza stores in the United States and for online purchases via www.dominos.com. The Card is a prepaid payment product. It is not a credit card, charge card or debit card. The value of the funds that are loaded onto the Card and are available for spending is referred to herein as the \"Available Funds.\" As you use the Card, the Card's Available Funds will be reduced by the full amount of each purchase including taxes, delivery or other charges, if any. </p> <h2>Purchasing a Card</h2> <p> Cards may be purchased at select retail locations, if available, or at www.dominos.com. If you purchase a Card at www.dominos.com, the Card will be mailed to you via U.S. mail to the address provided at time of purchase. </p> <h2>Before Using the Card</h2> <p> Each Card has a maximum Available Funds limit of $100.00. We suggest that you write down the Card number and the customer service number on a separate piece of paper, and print, if necessary, and retain the receipt for the Card. Lost, stolen, or destroyed cards will only be replaced if there is a balance on the card and proof of purchase is provided. Please see the section below entitled \"Refunds and Replacements\" for complete details. </p> <h2>Using the Card</h2> <p> To use the Card at a participating Domino's Pizza store, simply identify the card number to the customer service representative while ordering for delivery, or for carry out purchases, present the Card at the time of placing your order. Note: You may be required to provide the actual Card at time of delivery. You can locate a participating Domino's Pizza store by calling 1-800-DOMINOS or visiting www.dominos.com. You may wish to retain your receipts as a record of the transaction. The Card can be used to pay the full amount of the merchandise, delivery, and applicable taxes, so long as the Available Funds on the Card is sufficient. The Card cannot be used to purchase gift cards. The Available Funds cannot be redeemed for cash, unless required by law. If you want to make a purchase for an amount greater than the Available Funds on the Card, you may use the Available Funds on your Card to pay part of the total purchase cost and then pay the remaining balance of the purchase cost with another form of payment accepted by the Domino's Pizza store. Some Domino's Pizza stores may only be able to allow a split tender transaction (i.e., use of two forms of payment) if the second form of payment is cash, credit card or check. If you plan to use another form of payment to pay for a part of the total purchase cost, please check the specific Domino's Pizza store's policy prior to initiating the transaction. You agree: </p> <ul> <li>That Domino's Pizza or any participating Domino's Pizza franchisee or their vendor(s) are authorized to deduct the amount of your purchases, together with any other fees, taxes, or charges from the Available Funds on your Card whenever you use your Card to make a purchase.</li> <li>To track your spending, added value, and to not use the Card for any amount that exceeds the Available Funds.</li> <li>Not to permit any other person to use the Card issued to you.</li> <li>Not to use the Card at any locations other than participating Domino's Pizza stores located in the United States.</li> <li>Not to use the Card for any illegal purposes.</li> <li>To keep the Card securely and treat it like cash.</li> <li>To notify us at once if the Card is lost or stolen. If your Card is lost or stolen you can only obtain a refund for the Available Funds remaining on the Card as of the time you notify us of the loss. See the section entitled \"Refunds and Replacements\" below for complete details. Please note that purchases made with Cards are similar to those made with cash. You cannot \"stop payment\" or lodge a \"billing dispute\" on such transactions.</li> <li>Any problems or disputes you may have regarding a purchase transaction should be addressed directly with the Domino's Pizza store from which you purchased.</li> </ul> <h2>Information About Available Funds</h2> <p> You should keep track of the amount of Available Funds on the Card issued. To obtain the current Available Funds amount, you may call the toll free number on the back of the Card or check your account at www.dominos.com (if available). Your Available Funds will reflect all transactions that have been posted to our system. To reach Customer Service for the Card, please call 877-250-2278. If you have a question or a problem about a transaction posted to your Card (for example, a transaction that appears to be a duplicate transaction), you must notify us via email through the \"Contact Us\" link on www.dominos.com, immediately, but no later than sixty (60) days from the date of the transaction. You must include your Card number, the date and dollar amount of the error, and describe the error and explain as clearly as you can why you believe there is an error. We will investigate and will notify you of the results of our investigation within sixty (60) business days. </p> <h2>Refunds and Replacements</h2> <p> If your Card is lost, stolen, or used improperly, contact us immediately. You will be asked to provide us with the Card number, authorization code and date of purchase. We cannot provide a refund if you do not have your Card number, authorization code and date of purchase. If our records show that there are still Available Funds remaining on the Card, we will cancel the Card and refund such Available Fund amount to you. PLEASE SAFEGUARD YOUR CARD SECURELY AND TELL US IMMEDIATELY IF THE CARD IS LOST OR STOLEN. UNFORTUNATELY, NO REFUNDS WILL BE PROVIDED FOR AMOUNTS DEBITED FROM YOUR LOST/STOLEN CARD BEFORE YOU NOTIFY US. </p> <h2>Returns</h2> <p> If you wish to return any product purchased with the Card, you will be subject to the particular Domino's Pizza store's return policies and may be issued cash refund or store credit or the return of Available Funds to the Card. </p> <h2>Transactions in Excess of Available Funds</h2> <p> It is your responsibility to keep track of your purchases using the Card. You may also contact us for information on the amount of Available Funds on the Card (see \"Information About Available Funds\" above). If you attempt to use the Card when there are insufficient Available Funds for the transaction in question, the transaction in most instances will be declined. However, if due to a systems malfunction or for any reason whatsoever, a transaction occurs despite insufficient Available Funds on the Card (creating a \"negative\" amount, referred to herein as a \"Shortage\"), you agree to reimburse us, immediately upon request, for the amount of the Shortage. In addition, we reserve the right to charge you a Shortage fee of no less than $25.00 per transaction, or the maximum service charge permitted by law. </p> <h2>No Warranty of Availability or Uninterrupted Use</h2> <p> From time to time the Card service may be inoperative, and when this happens, you may be unable to use your Card or obtain information about Available Funds on your Card. Please notify us if you have any problems using your Card. You agree that Domino's Pizza is not responsible for any interruption of service. </p> <h2>No Warranty Regarding Goods and Services</h2> <p> Domino's Pizza is not responsible for the quality, safety, legality, or any other aspect of any goods or services purchased by you with your Card at Domino's Pizza stores not owned and operated by Domino's Pizza. Domino's Pizza franchisees are independent and separate businesses, not owned or operated by Domino's Pizza. The policies and practices of franchisees may vary according to their business practices and the state laws by which they are bound. </p> <h2>Refusal of Card</h2> <p> Domino's Pizza will not be liable for the failure of any establishment to honor the Card. </p> <h2>Changing the Gift Card Terms of Use & Card Cancellation</h2> <p> We may change the terms of or add new terms to these terms and conditions at any time, in accordance with applicable law. In addition, we may suspend, cancel, add, modify or delete any feature offered in connection with your Card at our sole discretion at any time, with or without cause, and without giving you notice, subject to applicable law. If we cancel your Card, any Available Funds remaining on the Card upon such cancellation after payment for all of your transaction and applicable fees will be returned to you. We may condition reimbursement upon return of the Card. The Card is the property of Domino's GC Inc. </p> <h2>Assignment and Waiver</h2> <p> We may assign this agreement to a successor, affiliate, parent or subsidiary at any time without notice to you. </p> <h2>Notices</h2> <p> Any notice given by us shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to you at the latest address shown on our records. </p> <p> You will violate our copyright and trademark rights if you purchase or produce coupons books with offers for Domino's Pizza and sell them on eBay. </p> <h2>Arbitration</h2> <p> To fairly resolve any dispute arising between you and Domino's Pizza regarding the use and purchase of any Card, you agree that any claims by either you or Domino's Pizza shall be settled exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association under its rules for the resolution of consumer-related disputes or other mutually agreeable procedures. You understand and agree that you will not participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by these terms and conditions. Purchase or use of the Card constitutes your acceptance of these arbitration terms. </p> <h2>Applicable Law</h2> <p> These terms and conditions are governed by the laws of the State of Michigan, USA, excluding choice of law principles.

Your use of the Web Sites or Applications constitutes your agreement to our Terms of Use, and acceptance of this Privacy Policy and your consent to the practices it describes.</p> <h2>Personally Identifiable Information</h2> <p>"Personally Identifiable Information” is any information that concerns you individually and would permit someone to identify you, for example, your first and last name, address, telephone number, email address, billing information, or any information you submit to the Web Sites or the Applications (including through voice ordering functionality available through the microphone on your phone using the mobile application or through a third party device microphone when using the Domino’s Anyware platform made available on numerous third party devices) that identifies you individually.</p> <h2>Information Collection</h2> <br> <h3>Information you provide</h3> <p>You may choose to disclose personally identifiable information about yourself and other information when using the Web Sites or Applications. The Web Sites and the Applications may collect information you provide directly by methods such as the following:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Registration Forms</strong> - If you are offered the opportunity to enter a promotion or to become a registered user of the Web Sites or Applications, you may be required to fill out a registration form on the Web Sites or Applications. This form may require certain information such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, areas of interest, product usage, credit/debit card number(s) with associated expiration date(s), CVV and billing zip code(s), and/or a unique individual password.</li> <li><strong>Transactions</strong> - If you conduct transactions through the Web Sites or Applications, we will collect information you provide directly about the transactions you engage in while on the Web Sites or Applications (including any data gathered through the Application while located in a Domino\'s Pizza store and when you speak to and use voice ordering services through the Domino’s Anyware platform, including through third party devices). This information may include payment and billing information as well as the nature, quantity and price of the goods or services you exchange, transcripts of any words that you speak while using voice ordering services through the Domino’s Anyware platform, including through third party devices, and the individuals or entities with whom you communicate or transact business.</li> <li><strong>Email and other voluntary communications; information inadvertently collected </strong> - You may also choose to communicate with us through email, via the Web Sites, via the Applications (including through voice ordering services through the Domino’s Anyware platform available on third party devices), or through other means. We collect the information in these communications, and such information may include personally identifiable information. Certain Applications, such as those utilizing the Domino’s Anyware platforms available on third party devices, may capture information that you do not intend to provide as part of the ordering process, such as background noise or secondary communications. Therefore, you should take steps to prevent the communication of unnecessary information when using such Applications.</li> </ul> <h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3> <p>When you visit the Web Sites or Applications (including when you use the Applications in a Domino’s Pizza store), certain “usage information” about your visit is automatically collected, which may include device identifier, information about the type of device, operating system and browser you use, the server name and IP address through which you access the internet (which identifies the company providing you internet access and general geographic information), the MAC address of the your device, the date and time you access the site, the pages you access while at the Web Sites or Applications, and the internet address of the web sites, if any, from which you linked directly to the Web Sites or Applications. Except to the extent required by applicable law, Domino’s Pizza does not consider usage information to be personally identifiable. To the extent that we combine usage information with your personally identifiable information, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information under this Privacy Policy.</p> <p>The methods that may be used on the Web Sites and Applications to collect usage information include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Log Information</strong> <p>Log information is data about your use of the Web Sites and Applications, such as IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related data, which is stored in log files.</p></li> <li> <strong>Information Collected by Tracking Technologies</strong><p>Cookies and other “tracking technologies” now and hereafter developed, some of which are listed below, may be used to collect information about your interactions with the Web Sites and Applications or emails, including information about your browsing and activity behavior.</p></li> <li> <strong>Cookies</strong> <p>The Web Sites\' and Applications\' servers, or the servers of third parties that are used to operate the Web Sites and Applications, may place a "cookie" on your computer, store data in your computer browser or access pre-existing removable tracking features on your mobile device in order to allow you to use the Web Sites and Applications and to personalize your experience. A "cookie" is a small piece of data that can be sent by a web server to your computer, which then may be stored by your browser on your computer\'s hard drive. Cookies and browser storage allow us to recognize your computer while you are on our Web Sites and Applications and help customize your online experience and make it more convenient for you. Cookies and browser storage are also useful in allowing more efficient log-in for users, tracking transaction histories and preserving information between sessions. The information collected from cookies and browser storage may also be used to improve the functionality of the Web Sites and Applications.</p> <p>Types of cookies and tags on our Web Sites and Applications include:</p> <ul> <li>Functionality: Used to remember your preferences and for facilitating transactions such as purchases.</li> <li>Performance or Analytics: Used to measure site activity to improve user experience.</li> <li>Targeting: Used to display information and offers that specifically interest you.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Local Storage</strong> <p>We use Local Storage, such as HTML5 storage, to store information related to whether the user has chosen to "Remain Logged In" as well as tokens if third party services are used. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity use Local Storage such as HTML 5 storage to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 Local Storage.</p> </li> <li> <strong>Web Beacons ("Tracking Pixels")</strong> <p>Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as "internet tags" or "clear gifs," embedded in web pages and email messages. Web beacons may be used to count the number of visitors to the Web Sites and Applications, to monitor how users navigate the Web Sites and Applications, and to count content views.</p> </li> <li> <strong>Embedded Scripts</strong> <p>An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Web Sites and Applications. It is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party with whom we work, is active only while you are connected to the Web Sites and Applications, and deleted or deactivated thereafter.</p> </li> <li> <strong>Location-identifying Technologies</strong> <p>GPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering, and other location-aware technologies locate (sometimes precisely) you for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting relevant content based on your location.</p> </li> <li> <strong>Voice Processing Technologies</strong> <p>Voice processing technologies use the data collected through the microphone on your device, including transcripts of any words that you speak, to analyze and provide information to you based on your requests. Although Domino’s does not collect your actual voice, third parties may have access to that information and you should review their privacy policies accordingly.</p> </li> <li> <strong>Device Fingerprinting</strong> <p>Device fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your device’s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in order to create a “fingerprint” of your device and uniquely identify your device and applications.</p> </li> <li> <strong>In-App Tracking Methods</strong> <p>There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifier, or other identifiers such as “Ad IDs” to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For further information on tracking technologies and your choices regarding them, please see “Analytics, Advertising, and Retargeting” and “Your Choices” below.</p> <h3>Information Collected from Third Parties</h3> <p>We may obtain information about you from other sources and combine such information with information we have collected about you. To the extent we combine such third party sourced information with personally identifiable information we have collected about you on the Web Sites and Applications, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information under this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the accuracy of any information provided by third parties or third party policies or practices.</p> <h2>Information Use</h2> <p>Domino\'s Pizza may use the information, including the personally identifiable information, collected through its Web Sites, Applications or stores for such purposes as:</p> <ul> <li>helping to establish and verify the identity of users;</li> <li>opening, maintaining, administering and servicing users\' accounts or memberships;</li> <li>processing, servicing or enforcing transactions and sending related communications;</li> <li>serving digital advertisements to you on third party ad properties;</li> <li>providing services and support to users;</li> <li>improving the Web Sites, Applications or stores, including tailoring them to users\' preferences;</li> <li>providing users with product or service updates, promotional notices and offers, and other information about Domino\'s Pizza and its affiliates;</li> <li>responding to your questions inquiries, comments and instructions;</li> <li>protecting our systems from fraud and unlawful access;</li> <li>maintaining the security and integrity of its systems;</li> <li>sending you newsletters and marketing communications; and</li> <li>fulfilling any other purposes consistent with our statements under this Privacy Policy or disclosed at the time you provide personally identifiable information.</li> </ul> <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2> <p>Domino\'s Pizza does not provide personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties for their use in marketing directly to you.

These social media features may use tracking technologies to collect information about you, such as your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Web Sites or Applications, and may set a cookie to enable the social media feature to function properly. If you use social media features, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on our Web Sites and Applications or by the third party service that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a third party service that references our Web Sites and Applications (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Domino’s Pizza in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with our Web Site and Applications. Also, both Domino’s Pizza and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of our Web Site and Applications and the social media features.

ALL MATTERS RELATING TO ARBITRATION WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, 9 U.S.C. SECTIONS 1‐16, AND NOT BY ANY STATE ARBITRATION LAW. </b> <br /><br /> Any arbitration pursuant to the Privacy Policy or Terms of Use shall be initiated with and conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, both of which may be obtained at <a href=\"http://www.adr.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.adr.org</a> or by calling (800)778‐7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in Washtenaw County, Michigan. Nothing herein shall prevent Domino’s Pizza or you from obtaining from a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunctive relief to preserve the status quo or to prevent any irreparable harm pending the arbitration of the underlying claim, dispute, and/or controversy. <br /><br /> The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted by a single arbitrator. In addition to any requirements imposed by law, the arbitrator shall be a retired state or federal court judge, or a licensed attorney with arbitration experience and at least ten years’ experience as a lawyer, and shall be subject to disqualification on the same grounds as would apply to a judge of a court in the relevant jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall follow controlling law and issue a decision in writing within 45 days of the arbitration hearing with a supporting opinion based on applicable law. The decision of the arbitrator (the “Decision”) shall be final, binding, and conclusive on the parties and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that You and Domino’s agree that the Decision may be appealed pursuant to the AAA’s Optional Appellate Arbitration Rules (“Appellate Rules”), which may be obtained at http://www.adr.org or by calling (800)778‐7879. The Decision shall not be considered final until after the time for filing the notice of appeal pursuant to the Appellate Rules has expired. Appeals must be initiated within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Decision, as defined by Rule A-3 of the Appellate Rules, by filing a Notice of Appeal with any AAA office. The single appellate arbitrator, who shall be chosen in the same manner described above, shall review the Decision applying the same standard(s) of review applicable in civil cases in the relevant jurisdiction and shall issue a reasoned award. The appellate arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties, and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. At either party’s election, such decision and supporting opinion may be appealed to another arbitrator (“appellate arbitrator”), who shall be chosen in the same manner as described above. The appellate arbitrator shall apply to the underlying decision and opinion the same standard for review of civil cases as an appellate court in the relevant jurisdiction and issue a decision in writing with a supporting opinion based on such review and applicable law. The appellate arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. <br /><br /> <b> WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT ON A CLASS-WIDE, COLLECTIVE, MULTIPLE‐PARTY, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS.

YOU AND DOMINO’S PIZZA BOTH UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION, BOTH ARE GIVING UP THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY INDIVIDUAL, CLASS-WIDE, COLLECTIVE, MULTIPLE‐PARTY, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR OTHER CLAIM EITHER MAY HAVE AGAINST THE OTHER, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN. </b> <br /><br /> Should any term or provision or portion of this arbitration agreement be declared void or unenforceable or deemed in contravention of law, it shall be severed and/or modified and the remainder of this agreement shall be enforceable; provided, however, that if the provision above prohibiting class-wide, collective action, consolidated, or other group arbitration is deemed invalid, then this entire arbitration provision shall be null and void and shall not apply to that dispute, which shall be resolved in a judicial proceeding in Washtenaw County, Michigan. </p> <h2>General</h2> <p> You agree that: (i) the Websites and Applications shall be deemed solely based in Michigan; and (ii) the Websites and Applications shall be deemed passive websites and applications that do not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Domino's, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Michigan.

These Terms of Use, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by Domino's on the Websites or Applications, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Domino's concerning the Websites and Applications. If any provision of these Terms of Use is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and the failure by Domino's to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

Domino's Pizza utilizes a standard agreement that requires its suppliers to comply with all applicable laws, which includes applicable labor laws. Domino's Pizza also provides to its suppliers a Code of Ethics that similarly notifies suppliers of their obligation to comply with all applicable laws and also provides a dedicated avenue for reporting any illegal or unethical behavior. Domino's Pizza conducts periodic assessments of its suppliers and is determining whether to expand this assessment to obtain information about its suppliers' activities related to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010. Domino's Pizza is also considering implementing requests for certification from its suppliers and/or audits of its suppliers. At this time, Domino's Pizza does not plan to utilize a third party to perform any verifications or audits. Domino's Pizza also expects to evaluate whether training and/or changes in accountability standards and procedures for its employees and/or contractors are appropriate. </p> <div> <br /><br /> These Terms of Use were updated as of March 06, 2017 </div> </div> </div> "},useData:!0}),this.overrides.convenientdinners=a.template({compiler:[7,">= 4.0.0"],main:function(a,b,c,d,e){var f=a.escapeExpression;return'<div id="coupons"> \x3c!-- SET PAGE --\x3e <div id="delivery"> \x3c!-- SET MAIN --\x3e <div id="order"> <div class="locations"> <div class="pizza"> '+f(c.prt.call(null!=b?b:a.nullContext||{},"aboutPizzaPageOrder",{name:"prt",hash:{},data:e}))+' <div id="online" class="head"> <div class="dominos"> <h1>Who Delivers Dinners Near Me?</h1> <p>You can stop your search for hot, delicious dinners.

Forget the off-brand lemon-lime substitute. These kids demand Sprite with every meal (and who can blame them?). But if you aren&#x2019;t a Sprite fan, you might be an orange Fanta fan. Totally acceptable &mdash; and quite classy, considering Fanta got its start in Germany. Regardless of whether you&#x2019;re Team Sprite or Team Fanta, Domino&#x2019;s has 20-ounce or 1-liter options for both drinks. And if it&#x2019;s simply bottled water you want, 20-ounce Dasani waters are a wish granted.</p> <h4>Order Drinks Online</h4> <p>Domino&#x2019;s mobile app and <a href="/en/about-pizza/online-delivery/">online ordering</a> make it easy to order everything you need for lunch or dinner.

But like a doughnut without frosting or spaghetti without meatballs, a pizza without garlic is incomplete.</p> <p>Garlic&#x2019;s delightfully pungent aroma and savory flavor is featured in our garlic Parmesan white sauce, which serves as both a popular sauce for pizzas and a dipping sauce. Prefer a garlic-infused red sauce? When checking out a <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-places/">pizza place</a> near you, try a Domino&#x2019;s pizza with marinara.</p> <h2>Garlic: a Tasteful Addition</h2> <p>The garlic-enhanced Parmesan white sauce serves as the base for the <a href="/en/pages/order/menu.jsp#/menu/category/viewAll/">Cali Bacon Chicken Ranch pizza</a> with premium grilled chicken breast, smoked bacon, tomatoes, and 100 percent real mozzarella and provolone cheeses on a cheesy provolone crust. Garlic elevates the mild grilled chicken, highlights the tangy tomatoes, and fortifies the salt of the bacon while mingling subtly with the melted cheese. The garlic Parmesan white sauce has the same effect on our crispy bacon and tomato specialty chicken, which features tender bites of lightly breaded, 100 percent whole breast white meat chicken, a blend of mozzarella and cheddar, crispy bacon and diced tomato. Conduct your own garlic flavor symphony by pairing our garlic Parmesan white sauce with toppings like chicken, Parmesan and mozzarella for a memorable white pizza. Add banana peppers, roasted peppers and feta cheese to garlic Parmesan white sauce for a vegetarian treat.</p> <h3>More Garlicky Options</h3> <p>Our rich and creamy Alfredo sauce also has a light whisper of garlic, just enough to bring out the nuttiness of the Parmesan and ripeness of the Asiago cheeses. Add Alfredo sauce to pizzas with steak and chicken, roasted red peppers and diced tomatoes. We also stir garlic into our hearty marinara sauce, where it creates a deep, rich flavor in a blend of pur&eacute;ed tomatoes and spices that is the foundation of countless pizza masterpieces. Garlic heightens the flavor of the spices and counterbalances the acidity of the tomatoes for a sauce that supports toppings from sausage and green olives to ham and pineapple.</p> <h4>Can&#x2019;t Get Enough Garlic?</h4> <p>Our oven-baked breadsticks are sprinkled with our garlic oil blend, instantly upgrading them from sideline to center stage. Experience them stuffed with cheese, covered in more melted cheese and dipped in your favorite sauce.

After stretching the dough, small gluten particles could remain on the pizza maker\'s hands, which then touch the cheese and toppings and could transfer to these ingredients. Due to the handcrafted nature of Domino\'s® products and because stores do not have a separate gluten free area in the kitchen, a possibility for gluten exposure can occur. As such, pizza made with Domino\'s® Gluten Free Crust is not recommended for customers with celiac disease. However, because the risk for exposure is low, this pizza made with Domino\'s® Gluten Free Crust is an option for individuals with mild gluten sensitivities.</div> </li> <li> <a href="#"><span>&#9660;</span> Is there gluten exposure in the store?<span></span></a> <div class="is-hidden">Because Domino&apos;s Gluten Free Crust pizza is prepared in a common kitchen, there is risk of gluten exposure.   Domino&apos;s&reg; conducted third party cross contamination studies of the pizzas made on the Gluten Free Crust. Results show, while there is some gluten in the store the amount of gluten exposure detected in the final pizza is low.  Please note that because our hand tossed pizzas are hand stretched using cornmeal, there is no airborne flour in our stores. You can watch the video above that explains while our Gluten Free Crust is free from gluten, there is a risk of gluten exposure.</div> </li> <li> <a href="#"><span>&#9660;</span> Why won&apos;t Domino&apos;s&reg; stores use a separate area of the kitchen or use new ingredients when making pizza with the Gluten Free Crust?<span></span></a> <div class="is-hidden">Domino&apos;s&reg; worked closely with a leading gluten awareness organization, which helped us recognize that with our current operational model we cannot, beyond all doubt, provide the environment needed to assure those with celiac disease that the whole pizza is 100 percent gluten free. Domino&apos;s&reg; does not want to set unrealistic expectations of how the Gluten Free Crust is handled in our stores. Domino&apos;s&reg; would rather be honest and transparent about this product and avoid risking a customer ordering this product under false pretenses. Domino&apos;s&reg; includes its Gluten Free Crust disclaimer in store, online, in all advertising and on small pizza boxes.</div> </li> <li> <a href="#"><span>&#9660;</span> Who should eat Domino&apos;s&reg;  Gluten Free Crust?<span></span></a> <div class="is-hidden">Domino&apos;s&reg;  Pizza does not give medical advice.

Even a very small amount of gluten contamination can cause an autoimmune reaction including both digestive and non-digestive symptoms, typically appearing a few hours or days after gluten has been ingested. <br/> <i>Gluten sensitivity:</i> According to a leading gluten awareness organization, gluten sensitivity affects 18 million Americans and falls within the spectrum of gluten-related disorders. Symptoms of gluten sensitivity often overlap with celiac disease. Unlike celiac disease, gluten sensitivity is not an autoimmune disease and does not result in the same type of intestinal damage. </div> </li> </ul> </ul> <h3 class="subSectionHeading">Send us an email</h3> <p>If we weren\'t able to answer your question in the above list, you may <a href="https://contactus.dominos.com/en/web/feedback" target="_blank">click here</a> to send us an email.</p> </div> '},useData:!0}),this.overrides.glutenfree=a.template({compiler:[7,">= 4.0.0"],main:function(a,b,c,d,e){var f=a.escapeExpression;return'<div id="coupons"> \x3c!-- SET PAGE --\x3e <div id="delivery"> \x3c!-- SET MAIN --\x3e <div id="order"> <div class="locations"> <div class="pizza"> '+f(c.prt.call(null!=b?b:a.nullContext||{},"aboutPizzaPageOrder",{name:"prt",hash:{},data:e}))+' <div id="online" class="head"> <div class="dominos"> <h1>Where Can I Find Gluten-Free Pizza Places Near Me?</h1> <p>Domino&#x2019;s Gluten Free Crust pizza was created to accommodate pizza fans who have a sensitivity to gluten.

When sprinkled over tomato sauce and melted cheese, their vibrant hue is reminiscent of merry holiday decorations. Domino&#x2019;s <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-restaurant/">pizza restaurant</a> offers green peppers as a topping for any pizza you&#x2019;d like.</p> <h2>Classic Green Pepper Combinations</h2> <p>Mild enough not to detract from other toppings, these peppers bring out the sweetness of other fruits while accentuating the spice of meats as well as the heat of their spicy cousins, habaneros and jalape&ntilde;os. Tried-and-true green pepper pizzas include the vegetarian green pepper, mushroom, and onion pizza, and the classic pepperoni and green pepper.</p> <p>We include green peppers, fresh onions and mushrooms on our Philly Cheese Steak pizza. One of our <a href="/en/pages/order/menu.jsp#/menu/category/viewAll/">Specialty Pizzas</a>, it is inspired by the iconic sandwich and features tender slices of steak with provolone and American cheeses on a cheesy provolone crust. The peppers provide a zesty contrast to the tender steak, and lend a vivid kick of color. We also use them on our Deluxe pizza, a classic pie that includes pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, onions, and 100 percent real mozzarella cheese.</p> <h3>Inspired Green Pepper Originals</h3> <p>To create less conventional pizzas with green peppers, take a cue from how they are typically prepared in the kitchen. Pair them with Italian sausage, diced tomatoes, and feta cheese, for instance, for a pizza version of stuffed peppers. Or add them to our Honolulu Hawaiian pizza, where they highlight the honey sweetness of pineapples and blend effortlessly with sliced ham, smoked bacon, and green pepper&#x2019;s close relative, the roasted red pepper. Since green peppers are often a part of shish kabobs on the grill, match green peppers with our grilled chicken on a pizza made with our Sweet Mango Habanero sauce and cheddar cheese on a provolone crust.</p> <p>Whether sprinkled on classic or original pizzas, or featured in an <a href="/en/pages/order/menu.jsp#/menu/category/viewAll/">Oven Baked Sandwich</a>, green peppers are a bright complement to toppings both savory and sweet.</p> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- SET SOCIAL --\x3e <div id="deals"> <div id="news"> <div id="reviews"></div> </div> <div id="local"> <div id="signup"></div> <div id="sitemap"> <a href="'+f(a.lambda(null!=b?b.ctx:b,b))+'/about-pizza/sitemap/">Sitemap</a> </div> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- END SOCIAL --\x3e <div class="clear"></div> </div> </div> </div> \x3c!-- END MAIN --\x3e </div> \x3c!-- END PAGE --\x3e </div> '},useData:!0}),this.overrides.habanero=a.template({compiler:[7,">= 4.0.0"],main:function(a,b,c,d,e){var f=a.escapeExpression;return'<div id="coupons"> \x3c!-- SET PAGE --\x3e <div id="delivery"> \x3c!-- SET MAIN --\x3e <div id="order"> <div class="locations"> <div class="pizza"> '+f(c.prt.call(null!=b?b:a.nullContext||{},"aboutPizzaPageOrder",{name:"prt",hash:{},data:e}))+' <div id="online" class="head"> <div class="dominos"> <h1>Does Habanero Dipping Sauce Taste Good on Pizza?</h1> <p>Habanero&#x2019;s infamous heat knocks the socks off the popular jalape&ntilde;o pepper (200,000 to 300,000 Scovilles vs. 2,500 to 8,000 Scovilles). But we&#x2019;ve combined the pepper with tangy vinegar, luscious pur&eacute;ed mango, tart orange and lime juices, and fruity bell peppers, making our Sweet Mango Habanero sauce a sweet and spicy one-two punch for pizza. When looking for a sauce to kick it up a notch, check out your local <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-places/">pizza place</a>-Domino&#x2019;s.</p> <h2>Habanero Adds a Kick to Pizza</h2> <p>Habanero&#x2019;s spirited personality is further tamed when covered with creamy, mild mozzarella, while its fruity parentage brings out the meaty flavors of classic pizza toppings like pepperoni and Italian sausage. Choose a side of Sweet Mango Habanero sauce for dipping slices of our <a href="/en/pages/order/menu.jsp#/menu/category/viewAll/">Honolulu Hawaiian pizza</a>, where the pepper&#x2019;s heat melds with the pineapple&#x2019;s sweetness for a wild taste experience.</p> <h3>Spice Up Chicken With Habanero Sauce</h3> <p>The zippy habanero is a natural match for mild chicken. Our <a href="/en/pages/order/menu.jsp#/menu/category/viewAll/">Chicken Habanero sandwich</a> features grilled chicken breast, diced pineapple, jalape&ntilde;os, Sweet Mango Habanero sauce, and melted provolone and cheddar cheeses on bread baked to a perfect golden brown. The habanero in the sauce provides a nudge of spice that is buoyed by the jalape&ntilde;o slices. Yet the pepper&#x2019;s heat won&#x2019;t overpower the other flavors in the sandwich or overstaying its welcome on your tongue. When paired with pineapple, the habanero moves beyond spiciness to take on a subtle, fruity tang.</p> <h4>Winging It With Sweet Mango Habanero</h4> <p>Our traditional chicken wings are marinated and oven baked. When they&#x2019;re tossed with Sweet Mango Habanero sauce, they&#x2019;re a wing lover&#x2019;s dream. With its beguiling orange hue, Sweet Mango Habanero sauce begs to be paired with our boneless chicken wings, which are lightly breaded with savory herbs. The first taste of pepper paired with chicken is a sweet promise, followed by a warm embrace.</p> <p>Recognizing that everyone registers peppers &mdash; from bell and banana to jalape&ntilde;o and habanero &mdash; on individual spice-o-meters, we offer light or normal spice options to ensure pizzas, sandwiches and wings made with habanero deliver a Goldilocks-like heat: not too much, not too little, but just right.

But if that doesn&#x2019;t appeal, not to worry. Domino&#x2019;s is the <a href="../../../pizza-places/">pizza place</a> where ham is compatible with a wide variety of other flavors. It pairs well with other meats, as well as veggies, cheeses and fruit.</p> <h2>Ham&#x2019;s Hawaiian Vacation</h2> <p>Ham came into its own as a pizza topping when it was first paired with pineapple to create the classic Hawaiian pizza. The savory/sweet ham and pineapple connection, like chocolate-covered pretzels or salted caramels, works for complicated science-y reasons (something about the SGLT1 receptor in taste buds), which is why ham and fruit pizza is a no-brainer for some and a no-go for others.</p> <h3>Classic Ham and Cheese</h3> <p>The ham and cheese sandwich is standard lunch fare for a reason: ham adds texture to creamy cheese and brings out its nuanced flavors, like the nuttiness of Parmesan and sharpness of cheddar. For this reason, our Domino&#x2019;s <a href="../../../pizza-restaurant/">Pizza restaurants</a> can include ham as a great addition to our Wisconsin 6 Cheese pizza, which combines 100 percent real mozzarella, feta, provolone, cheddar, Parmesan, and Asiago cheeses, sprinkled with oregano on a cheesy Parmesan/Asiago crust. Create a one-of-a-kind pizza homage to the ham and cheese sandwich with our Alfredo sauce spread on <a href="../../crusts/hand-tossed/">hand-tossed crust</a> and piled with a combination of your favorite cheeses.</p> <p>Just as veggies are added to enhance a ham and cheese sandwich, they are tasty on pizza as well. Try ham with green peppers, diced tomatoes, mushrooms, and black olives for a pizza that is deliciously straightforward.</p> <h4>More Ham Combinations</h4> <p>Ham has the ability to stand up for itself even when paired with other meat toppings on pizza. Domino&#x2019;s <a href="../../../pizza-restaurant/">Pizza restaurants</a> include it on the ExtravaganZZa Feast<sup>&reg;</sup> pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage, beef, fresh onions, green peppers, mushrooms, and black olives topped with extra cheese made with 100 percent real mozzarella. It also joins the cast of toppings that make up our MeatZZa Feast<sup>&reg;</sup> pizza, which is topped with ham, <a href="../pepperoni/">pepperoni</a>, Italian sausage, and beef with extra real mozzarella cheese. It is also a great addition to spicy foods. It can temper the heat of our Sweet Mango Habanero sauce and provide a mellow respite on pizzas that feature hot sauce and jalape&ntilde;os.</p> <p>Whether playing sidekick to pineapple or other fruits (like banana peppers and roasted red peppers), mingling with the spice of other meats (like pepperoni and Italian sausage), or buffering the heat of hot sauce, ham is a versatile &mdash; and popular &mdash; pizza topping.</p> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- SET SOCIAL --\x3e <div id="deals"> <div id="news"> <div id="reviews"></div> </div> <div id="local"> <div id="signup"></div> <div id="sitemap"> <a href="'+f(a.lambda(null!=b?b.ctx:b,b))+'/about-pizza/sitemap/">Sitemap</a> </div> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- END SOCIAL --\x3e <div class="clear"></div> </div> </div> </div> \x3c!-- END MAIN --\x3e </div> \x3c!-- END PAGE --\x3e </div> '},useData:!0}),this.overrides.handmadepan=a.template({compiler:[7,">= 4.0.0"],main:function(a,b,c,d,e){var f=a.escapeExpression;return'<div id="coupons"> \x3c!-- SET PAGE --\x3e <div id="delivery"> \x3c!-- SET MAIN --\x3e <div id="order"> <div class="locations"> <div class="pizza"> '+f(c.prt.call(null!=b?b:a.nullContext||{},"aboutPizzaPageOrder",{name:"prt",hash:{},data:e}))+' <div id="online" class="head"> <div class="dominos"> <h1>What&#x2019;s the Handmade Pan Pizza Difference?</h1> <p>Domino&#x2019;s Handmade Pan Pizza debuted on our <a href="../../../pizza-restaurant/">pizza restaurant</a> menu in 2012 to rave reviews.

There&#x2019;s no mission more important to Domino&#x2019;s than creating the perfect Hand Tossed pizza, and all of Domino&#x2019;s pizza makers go through a rigorous training program to learn the art and science of the Hand Tossed technique.</p> <p>Each Hand Tossed pizza begins as a ball of dough that is kneaded, spun, and stretched until it&#x2019;s the right size. Domino&#x2019;s pizza makers are trained to judge every Hand Tossed crust&#x2019;s thickness and circumference so that it fits perfectly on the baking screen. Once the crust is properly stretched, it&#x2019;s baked in a state-of-the-art oven. When the Hand Tossed pizza comes out as piping-hot perfection, the crust is sprinkled with a garlic seasoning blend that enhances the flavor.</p> <h3>From Dinners to Parties</h3> <p>Each pizza maker at every Domino&#x2019;s <a href="../../../pizza-places/">pizza place</a> has his or her favorite to make, but the Hand Tossed stands out as a top choice for both our pizza makers and our customers.

At Domino&#x2019;s, you can add hot sauce to any meal you&#x2019;d like. Whether it&#x2019;s your pizza, <a href="/en/about-pizza/options/topping/chicken/">chicken</a>, or sandwich that needs a little punch, Domino&#x2019;s hot sauce is perfect for dipping &mdash; or just order these items with it already drizzled on top.</p> <p>The easiest way to set your senses on fire? Order <a href="../../../../about-pizza/chicken-wings/">chicken wings</a> with hot sauce, or order the Classic Hot Buffalo Specialty Chicken. Your lips are sure to tingle by the end of your meal, but you won&#x2019;t regret it &mdash; and neither will your party guests. Plus, a few sides of <a href="../../../../about-pizza/options/sides/ranch/">ranch</a> and blue cheese sauce will tone down the spiciness. The creamy base of each dipping sauce allows the heat to gradually build. Regardless of how you choose to enjoy Domino&#x2019;s hot sauce, once it hits you, you&#x2019;ll understand why we call it the &ldquo;Kicker Hot Sauce.&rdquo;</p> <h2>This Hot Sauce Is a Kick</h2> <p>The perfect hot sauce is a highly debated subject, considering there are so many different types. But when it comes to the ideal Buffalo sauce, we think we have it. With an immediate hit of mouth-tingling spice and a smoky flavor to finish it out, it&#x2019;s delicious on pizzas or on the side.</p> <h3>Pizzas and Sandwiches Need This Hot Sauce</h3> <p>Chicken wings get messy, and for those who love wings but don&#x2019;t want their fingers covered in hot sauce, we recommend turning your pizza into an homage to the poultry favorite. <a href="../../../../about-pizza/options/topping/buffalo-chicken/">Buffalo Chicken</a> pizza is a great alternative, but you still might need that ranch sauce for those who are afraid of the immediate heat. If you&#x2019;re not a chicken wings kind of person, try the Fiery Hawaiian Pizza. It&#x2019;s amazing how the sweetness of pineapples brings out the smoky Buffalo flavor in the sauce. Don&#x2019;t forget that you can add it to any pizza (get creative and build your own!). In the mood for a sandwich? The Buffalo Chicken is just what you need.</p> <h4>Try It Today</h4> <p>If you&#x2019;re reluctant to add hot sauce directly to your meal, order the dipping cup just to be safe. Drizzle it on a slice or dip your boneless wings in it. We think you will be pleasantly surprised. Go ahead and try it today with carryout or <a href="../../../../about-pizza/pizza-delivery/">delivery</a> and let Domino&#x2019;s be your neighborhood <a href="../../../../about-pizza/pizza-places/">pizza place</a>.

Our Italian sandwich is loaded with pepperoni, salami, ham, banana and green peppers, and onions. And once the Italian sandwich reaches our pizza oven, all those ingredients are brought together with bubbly, melting provolone cheese, toasted until the cheese is perfectly melted and browned.</p> <p>Our Italian sandwich is then on its way to you in our sandwich boxes, designed to keep your Italian sandwich hot along the way. We created these sandwich boxes so that when your sandwich arrives at your home or office (or blanket at the park), it tastes as if it just came out of one of our pizza ovens.</p> <h2> Ingredients Are Key in Our Italian Sandwich</h2> <p>The Domino&#x2019;s Italian oven-baked sandwich is always a favorite because of our commitment to the finest ingredients &mdash; ingredients such as the banana peppers that give our Italian sandwich a signature kick. We pride ourselves on using only the finest available ingredients and believe that our high-quality standards make a difference you can taste. And just as with our pizzas, the provolone cheese used on our Italian sandwich is 100 percent real cheese. Likewise, the salami in our Italian sandwich gives the sandwich a spicy boost of peppercorn goodness.

Spicy and rich, the perfect complement to gooey cheese, <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-crust/">a golden crust</a>, and a variety of toppings, it is the <a href="/en/pages/order/menu.jsp#/menu/category/viewAll/">ultimate pizza topping</a>. With easy online ordering, we&#x2019;ll have your Domino&#x2019;s pizza with Italian sausage from our <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-places/">pizza place</a> to your door, in no time.</p> <h2>Italian Sausage Makes Powerful Pizza</h2> <p>Italian sausage is like the muscular bodybuilder of pizza toppings. Capable of carrying the entire pizza on its own broad shoulders, it also works well with others. It is the perfect counterpoint to sweet and spicy peppers, as evidenced by the popularity of sandwiches that feature the combination. Pair our robust inspired tomato sauce with sausage and a <a href="/en/about-pizza/vegetarian/">medley of peppers</a> &mdash; banana, roasted red, green, and jalape&ntilde;o &mdash; and a blend of mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses for a pizza that is both classic and inspired.</p> <p>The sausage also pairs well with less traditional pizza sauces, like Alfredo and our garlic Parmesan white sauce. Top either with sausage, spinach, diced tomatoes and Parmesan cheese for a taste of the Mediterranean.</p> <h3>Italian Sausage Is a Bona Fide Favorite</h3> <p>Italian sausage owes its bravado to a classic blend of spices that have formed the foundation of Mediterranean cooking for generations. Garlic, fennel, paprika, chili powder, and other spices are blended with premium pork to create flavor reminiscent of Mom&#x2019;s spaghetti sauce and Grandma&#x2019;s meatloaf. Nostalgia aside, the meat is <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-restaurant/">American&#x2019;s second-favorite pizza topping</a>. For that reason, it has earned a coveted place on several of our Specialty Pizzas:</p> <ul> <li>Deluxe includes pepperoni, Italian sausage, fresh green peppers, mushrooms, onions and 100 percent real mozzarella cheese.</li> <li>ExtravaganZZa combines pepperoni, ham, Italian sausage, beef, onions, green peppers, mushrooms and black olives topped with extra mozzarella.</li> <li>MeatZZa features pepperoni, ham, Italian sausage and beef topped with extra mozzarella.</li> </ul> <h4>No Matter How You Slice It</h4> <p>We use sliced sausage in our Oven Baked Sandwich that pairs the meat with roasted red peppers, fresh green peppers, banana peppers, fresh onions, plus provolone cheese and tomato basil marinara sauce on a delicious crust baked to a perfect golden brown.</p> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- SET SOCIAL --\x3e <div id="deals"> <div id="news"> <div id="reviews"></div> </div> <div id="local"> <div id="signup"></div> <div id="sitemap"> <a href="'+f(a.lambda(null!=b?b.ctx:b,b))+'/about-pizza/sitemap/">Sitemap</a> </div> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- END SOCIAL --\x3e <div class="clear"></div> </div> </div> </div> \x3c!-- END MAIN --\x3e </div> \x3c!-- END PAGE --\x3e </div> '},useData:!0}),this.overrides.items=a.template({compiler:[7,">= 4.0.0"],main:function(a,b,c,d,e){var f,g=a.lambda,h=a.escapeExpression;return'<li class="grid"> <div class="grid__cell--3/8@desktop grid__cell--1"> <img src=\''+h(g(null!=b?b.market_assets_ctx:b,b))+"/images/img/nutritional-page/lighter-options/"+h(g(null!=b?b.img:b,b))+".png' alt='"+h(g(null!=b?b.title:b,b))+'\' /> <div class="description"><strong>'+h(g(null!=b?b.title:b,b))+"</strong><p>"+h(g(null!=b?b.desc:b,b))+"</p></div> </div> <div class=\"grid__cell--5/8@desktop grid__cell--1 card__body--overflow-x\"> <table title='nutritionTable' class=\"table--nutrition\" cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0'> <thead> <tr> <th>1/8 of Pizza</th> <th>Weight g (oz)</th> <th>Calories</th> <th>Saturated Fat (g)</th> <th>Sodium (mg)</th> <th>Total Sugars (g)</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> "+(null!=(f=g(null!=b?b.sizes:b,b))?f:"")+" </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </li> "},useData:!0}),this.overrides.jalapenopeppers=a.template({compiler:[7,">= 4.0.0"],main:function(a,b,c,d,e){var f=a.escapeExpression;return'<div id="coupons"> \x3c!-- SET PAGE --\x3e <div id="delivery"> \x3c!-- SET MAIN --\x3e <div id="order"> <div class="locations"> <div class="pizza"> '+f(c.prt.call(null!=b?b:a.nullContext||{},"aboutPizzaPageOrder",{name:"prt",hash:{},data:e}))+' <div id="online" class="head"> <div class="dominos"> <h1>Does Domino&#x2019;s Pizza Have Jalape&ntilde;o Peppers?</h1> <p>Domino&#x2019;s <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-restaurant/">pizza restaurant</a> encourages our customers to customize their pizzas any way they like, including adding a little bit (or a lot) of heat to their favorite pizza. Jalape&ntilde;o peppers have a mild to medium piquancy, which means they are a kicky, yet not too sassy, addition to pizza. The little green orbs enliven the most basic of pies. They also increase the color quotient &mdash; and flavor profile &mdash; of our Honolulu Hawaiian pizza, with sliced ham, smoked bacon, and sweet pineapples. Because they are a fruit &mdash; they have seeds, after all &mdash; they pair well with other fruits, like pineapples, diced tomatoes, banana peppers, and roasted red peppers.</p> <h2>Mix and Match Spice With Jalape&ntilde;o Peppers</h2> <p>The spiciness of the pepperoni pairs with the heat of the jalape&ntilde;os, and the polka-dot effect of the round pepperonis and pepper discs is as delightful as it is delectable.</p> <p>Pair jalape&ntilde;o peppers with other spicy toppings to create a feisty pizza. Start with our Sweet Mango Habanero sauce, then add jalape&ntilde;os, banana peppers, and hot sauce for layers of heat that ebb and flow on the tongue like waves on a beach. Jalape&ntilde;os are also a solid choice for <a href="/en/about-pizza/vegetarian/">vegetarian pizza creations</a>, like jalape&ntilde;o, green pepper, and fresh onion, or jalape&ntilde;o with diced tomatoes and black olives.</p> <p>Create a zesty experience by adding jalape&ntilde;o peppers to our MeatZZa pizza, where pepperoni, ham, Italian sausage, and beef contribute meatiness, while the peppers bring spice to the party without insisting on being center stage. Unearth an unexpected pizza gem by pairing BBQ sauce and jalape&ntilde;os, which bring out the sweet smokiness of the sauce when combined with bacon, beef, sliced ham, onions, diced tomatoes, and provolone cheese.</p> <h3>Add Jalape&ntilde;o Peppers to Chicken and Sandwiches, Too</h3> <p>Jalape&ntilde;o peppers add spice to our Oven Baked Sandwiches, as well. Our Chicken Habanero sandwich features jalape&ntilde;os with grilled chicken breast, pineapple, Sweet Mango Habanero sauce, and provolone and cheddar cheeses on bread baked to a perfect golden brown.</p> <p>The understated heat of the peppers also stars in our Spicy Jalape&ntilde;o Pepper - Pineapple Specialty Chicken. Tender bites of lightly breaded, 100 percent whole breast white meat chicken are topped with Sweet Mango Habanero sauce, a blend of mozzarella and cheddar cheeses, jalape&ntilde;os, and pineapple. Peppers also accentuate the smoked meat in our Stuffed Cheesy Bread with Bacon &amp; Jalape&ntilde;o, which is covered with cheese and seasoned with a sprinkling of garlic, parsley and Romano cheese.</p> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- SET SOCIAL --\x3e <div id="deals"> <div id="news"> <div id="reviews"></div> </div> <div id="local"> <div id="signup"></div> <div id="sitemap"> <a href="'+f(a.lambda(null!=b?b.ctx:b,b))+'/about-pizza/sitemap/">Sitemap</a> </div> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- END SOCIAL --\x3e <div class="clear"></div> </div> </div> </div> \x3c!-- END MAIN --\x3e </div> \x3c!-- END PAGE --\x3e </div> '},useData:!0}),this.overrides.large=a.template({compiler:[7,">= 4.0.0"],main:function(a,b,c,d,e){var f=a.escapeExpression;return'<div id="coupons"> \x3c!-- SET PAGE --\x3e <div id="delivery"> \x3c!-- SET MAIN --\x3e <div id="order"> <div class="locations"> <div class="pizza"> '+f(c.prt.call(null!=b?b:a.nullContext||{},"aboutPizzaPageOrder",{name:"prt",hash:{},data:e}))+' <div id="online" class="head"> <div class="dominos"> <h1>Who Offers Deals on Large Pizzas?</h1> <p>Domino&#x2019;s always has great deals and special offers on large pizzas.

This decadent confection is what happens when a milk chocolate chunk cookie meets a fudge brownie. The result? More than one way to satisfy a sweet tooth.</p> <p>How do we create this beauty? First, we layer and swirl the two batters in a pan. Then we bake the swirled batter until it reaches fresh-from-the-oven perfection. Once cooled, each pan of Marbled Cookie Brownie is cut into nine squares, which means there&#x2019;s plenty of the dessert to share (if you&#x2019;re feeling generous).</p> <p>The Marbled Cookie Brownie is baked only when you order it &mdash; and it is perfection every single time.</p> <h2>A Marble-ous Addition</h2> <p>When we added the Marbled Cookie Brownie to our menu, it became an instant hit. Domino&#x2019;s customers love our classic desserts &mdash; Cinna Stix<sup>&reg;</sup> and Chocolate Lava Crunch Cake &mdash; and the Marbled Cookie Brownie quickly became a fan favorite as well. Why? Because no one wants to choose between a warm chocolate chip cookie and an ooey gooey brownie.

Herbs. Red peppers. Marinara can be as simple as three ingredients. Domino&#x2019;s uses those things, but we like to keep our recipe a secret. What we have created is a rich, satisfying sauce with tomato-y sweetness and hints of spice. We&#x2019;ll give you a clue. The marinara at our <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-places/">pizza place</a> is sauceome.</p> <h2>Everything Pairs With Domino&#x2019;s Marinara</h2> <p>Nothing says Italian food quite like marinara. This sweet, robust tomato sauce has been around for quite some time, thanks to Naples, Italy. Though the first written record of the sauce comes from a 1692 cookbook, it is said that the sauce was prepared by the wives of Neapolitan sailors upon their return from sea. The sauce clearly has its roots and history in Italy, but the United States has come to love the same delicious sauce.</p> <p>At Domino&#x2019;s, we offer it in a dipping cup on the side or added to your pizza. That&#x2019;s right, pump up your pizza <a href="/en/about-pizza/online-delivery/">order</a> and go for the hearty marinara sauce. This would be a great addition to the traditional <a href="/en/about-pizza/options/topping/pepperoni">pepperoni</a> pizza. We also recommend trying the sauce with the MeatZZa Feast<sup>&reg;</sup> pizza and the <a href="/en/about-pizza/vegetarian/">Pacific Veggie pizza</a>.</p> <h3>Marinara Makes the Perfect Dipping Sauce</h3> <p>Our <a href="/en/about-pizza/other-foods/dominos/breadsticks">breadsticks</a>, coated with butter, garlic, and herbs, go wonderfully with the marinara dipping cup, creating the perfect blend of sweet and salty. If you want to spice up your breadstick game, try our Parmesan Bread Bites or Cheesy Bread to go along with the sauce. (You can never go wrong with cheese and tomatoes.) If breadsticks aren&#x2019;t your style, you might prefer to dip your sandwich in marinara. The Chicken Parm Oven Baked Sandwich offers the right amount of Parmesan cheese taste but adds flavor to premium chicken. The sweeter sauce pairs well with the <a href="/en/about-pizza/other-foods/dominos/italian-sandwich">Italian Sausage</a> &amp; Peppers. The original Italian sandwich is also a great option for dipping.</p> <h4>Add Marinara Today</h4> <p>Everyone loves marinara sauce. It goes with nearly everything, and it&#x2019;s not too flashy. Trust us when we say that once you try the sauce at Domino&#x2019;s, you will realize there is so much more marinara has to offer.

Equally compatible with veggies and meats, mushrooms also pair well with traditional tomato sauces as well as white pizza sauces like Alfredo and garlic Parmesan. And although debate remains on whether mushrooms are technically fungi or vegetable, for many pizza connoisseurs, mushrooms are considered a must on pizzas of any kind. Check out your local Domino&#x2019;s pizza restaurant and try your favorite pizza with mushrooms today.</p> <h2>Mushrooms Play Well With Others</h2> <p>When scattered atop your favorite pizza, mushrooms have the amazing ability to impart their own distinct flavor, while simultaneously acting as a flavor sponge when paired with other ingredients. Mushrooms mimic the meaty texture of Italian sausage, for instance, and take on a delicate spice when paired with it. For this reason, we include fresh mushrooms on <a href="../../../../about-pizza/about-menu/">several of our Specialty Pizzas</a>, including the Deluxe Feast<sup>&reg;</sup>, which features pepperoni, Italian sausage, fresh green peppers, fresh onions and 100 percent real mozzarella cheese. The fresh mushrooms are like a third meat on this pizza, but at the same time, the mushrooms elevate the flavors of the fresh veggies.</p> <p>The mushroom&#x2019;s reputation as a well-loved pizza topping is only confirmed by America&#x2019;s Favorite Feast<sup>&reg;</sup> pizza, which includes fresh mushrooms, pepperoni, Italian sausage, and 100 percent real mozzarella. Our ExtraganZZa Feast<sup>&reg;</sup> pizza showcases the versatility of mushrooms: fresh mushrooms are paired with pepperoni, ham, Italian sausage, beef, fresh onions, fresh green peppers, and black olives, and then topped with extra mozzarella cheese. With so many toppings to choose from, this <a href="../../../../about-pizza/pizza-restaurant/">pizza restaurant</a> is sure to deliver options the whole family will enjoy.</p> <h3>Add Texture With Mushrooms</h3> <p>Mushrooms lend a chewy, hearty texture to pizzas like our Pacific Veggie, which includes fresh mushrooms, roasted red peppers, fresh baby spinach, fresh onions, diced tomatoes, black olives and mozzarella, feta and provolone cheeses sprinkled with garlic herb seasoning on a cheesy Parmesan Asiago crust. Make a mushroom masterpiece by combining fresh mushrooms with bacon and Parmesan cheese for a pizza that is delicious in its simplicity. Like adding mushrooms to a cheeseburger, include them on our <a href="../../../../about-pizza/">Bacon Cheeseburger Feast<sup>&reg;</sup> pizza</a>, which pairs smoked bacon and beef with 100 percent real mozzarella and cheddar cheeses.</p> <p>Mushrooms are also a meaty addition to pizzas made with our Garlic Parmesan White sauce, especially when paired with baby spinach and diced tomatoes. Recreate Mom&#x2019;s traditional hamburger stroganoff in pizza form with Garlic Parmesan White sauce, fresh mushrooms and beef. Or take inspiration from pasta dishes by starting with our Alfredo sauce, then adding fresh mushrooms and a variety of melted cheeses. The addition of mushrooms adds a layer of flavor sophistication to both classic and original pizzas.</p> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- SET SOCIAL --\x3e <div id="deals"> <div id="news"> <div id="reviews"></div> </div> <div id="local"> <div id="signup"></div> <div id="sitemap"> <a href="'+f(a.lambda(null!=b?b.ctx:b,b))+'/about-pizza/sitemap/">Sitemap</a> </div> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- END SOCIAL --\x3e <div class="clear"></div> </div> </div> </div> \x3c!-- END MAIN --\x3e </div> \x3c!-- END PAGE --\x3e </div> '},useData:!0}),this.overrides.nearbyrestaurants=a.template({compiler:[7,">= 4.0.0"],main:function(a,b,c,d,e){var f=a.escapeExpression;return'<div id="coupons"> \x3c!-- SET PAGE --\x3e <div id="delivery"> \x3c!-- SET MAIN --\x3e <div id="order"> <div class="locations"> <div class="pizza"> '+f(c.prt.call(null!=b?b:a.nullContext||{},"aboutPizzaPageOrder",{name:"prt",hash:{},data:e}))+' <div id="online" class="head"> <div class="dominos"> <h1>What Restaurants Are Nearby?</h1> <p>When you&#x2019;re looking for nearby restaurants, you&#x2019;ll always find a Domino&#x2019;s!

The secret to the perfect New York-style pizza is in the massive, <a href="/en/about-pizza/options/crusts/hand-tossed/">hand-tossed crust</a>. It must be thin, crispy on the edges, but soft and foldable on the interior.</p> <p>Plain mozzarella cheese is a staple, but don&#x2019;t be shy if you prefer pepperoni or other toppings.

No matter your preference, Domino&#x2019;s <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-restaurant/">pizza restaurant</a> has a pizza with onions for you.

We include fresh onions on our <a href="/en/pages/order/menu.jsp#/menu/category/viewAll/">Spinach &amp; Feta pizza</a>, where the onions blend with the leafy spinach and highlight feta&#x2019;s creamy tang. Onions elevate the flavor of the toppings on our Pacific Veggie pizza, which includes roasted red peppers, fresh baby spinach, fresh mushrooms, diced tomatoes, black olives and a blend of cheeses sprinkled with garlic herb seasoning on a hand-tossed crust.</p> <p>Onions also highlight the rich flavors of meats like pepperoni, Italian sausage, ham and beef, which we pair with fresh onions, green peppers, fresh mushrooms, black olives and 100 percent real mozzarella cheese on our ExtravaganZZa&trade; pizza. Onions bring a welcome bite to our <a href="/en/about-pizza/philly-cheese-steak/">Philly Cheese Steak pizza</a>, which features tender slices of steak, fresh onions, fresh green peppers, and fresh mushrooms with provolone and American cheeses on a cheesy provolone crust. Proving their ability to enhance a wide variety of flavors, onions are part of our Deluxe pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage, fresh green peppers, fresh mushrooms, fresh onions and cheese made with 100 percent real mozzarella.</p> <h3>Use Onions to Create Pizza Originals</h3> <p>The subtle spice of onions can serve as a bridge between pizza toppings. When added to our Honolulu Hawaiian pizza, onions work perfectly with ham, bacon and pineapple. Added to our Wisconsin 6 Cheese pizza, onions blend with mozzarella, provide extra tang to feta, build on provolone&#x2019;s mild character, pair with the sharpness of cheddar, and highlight the nuttiness of Parmesan and Asiago cheeses.</p> <p>You can also use onions to recreate the pizza version of a warm spinach salad by combining our Garlic Parmesan White Sauce with fresh spinach, bacon and fresh onions. Onions bring out the rich creaminess of our Alfredo sauce when paired with our premium chicken on a pizza topped with Parmesan and provolone cheese. As a pizza topping, onions are more than a mere add-on. Onions tantalize with their ability to highlight, enhance, meld and mingle with any flavor they are paired with.</p> <p><a href="/en/pages/order/#/locations/search/">Order online today!</a></p> </div> \x3c!-- SET SOCIAL --\x3e <div id="deals"> <div id="news"> <div id="reviews"></div> </div> <div id="local"> <div id="signup"></div> <div id="sitemap"> <a href="'+f(a.lambda(null!=b?b.ctx:b,b))+'/about-pizza/sitemap/">Sitemap</a> </div> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- END SOCIAL --\x3e <div class="clear"></div> </div> </div> </div> \x3c!-- END MAIN --\x3e </div> \x3c!-- END PAGE --\x3e </div> '},useData:!0}),this.overrides.onlinedelivery=a.template({compiler:[7,">= 4.0.0"],main:function(a,b,c,d,e){var f=a.escapeExpression;return'<div id="coupons"> \x3c!-- SET PAGE --\x3e <div id="delivery"> \x3c!-- SET MAIN --\x3e <div id="order"> <div class="locations"> <div class="pizza"> '+f(c.prt.call(null!=b?b:a.nullContext||{},"aboutPizzaPageOrder",{name:"prt",hash:{},data:e}))+' <div id="online" class="head"> <div class="dominos"> <h1>Who Offers Online Delivery Near Me?</h1> Online delivery is a great option when you&#x2019;re hungry for hot, delicious, hassle-free food.

With origins in northern Italy, Parmesan is a hard, dry, white cheese that&#x2019;s typically grated and used as a topping to add texture and enhance flavors (and it&#x2019;s often misspelled Parmesean or Parmasean). You&#x2019;ll find the cheese in just about every Italian food dish, from pastas and pizzas to soups. People also love it on salads and veggies.</p> <p>Parmesan also plays a starring role in our Parmesan Bread Bites, little nuggets of pizza dough covered in cheese and then baked to perfection.</p> <p>Domino&#x2019;s customers love the flavor so much that a shredded Parmesan-Asiago cheese blend is often selected with the <a href="/en/pages/order/#/section/Food/category/AllEntrees/">Build Your Own Pizza</a> option. For <a href="/en/pages/order/#/section/Food/category/Pasta/">Build Your Own Pasta</a> lovers, shredded Parmesan is a top choice. And if you can&#x2019;t get enough, you&#x2019;ll find it on the Chicken Parm <a href="/en/pages/order/#/section/Food/category/Sandwich/">sandwich</a>, as well as the Crispy Bacon &amp; Tomato Specialty Chicken.</p> <p>In fact, grated Parmesan cheese is so popular with Domino&#x2019;s customers that we make it available in a special shaker bottle perfect for <a href="/en/pages/order/menu.jsp#/menu/category/sides/">topping pizzas, pasta, and breadsticks</a>.</p> <h2>Domino&#x2019;s Cheeses Include Parmesan</h2> <p>Whether you&#x2019;re ordering a Hand Tossed, Brooklyn Style, Handmade Pan, Crunchy Thin, or the Gluten-Free crust, cheese is a must-have ingredient. Domino&#x2019;s has a long list of cheese options, including mozzarella, cheddar, provolone, feta, and Parmesan-Asiago. Select your favorites, or mix and match to try something new.

Whether it&#x2019;s a big, steaming bowl of your mom&#x2019;s spaghetti and homemade meatballs that always cheered you up or the palate pleasures of seafood linguine, pasta is a versatile and delicious staple of Italian cuisine. When paired with a rich, vibrant sauce, pasta can be reimagined in countless ways. For even the pickiest of eaters, pasta is usually a pretty safe bet.</p> <p>Domino&#x2019;s offers a variety of pasta dishes sure to please solo diners and crowds alike, and each dish is available for snappy delivery from a <a href="../../../../about-pizza/pizza-restaurant/">restaurant</a> near you. Simply select your closest location online, and order away.</p> <h2>Pasta: an International Favorite for Centuries</h2> <p>Historical references to pasta in literature date back to as early as 1 B.C., so it&#x2019;s safe to say that pasta&#x2019;s long-term popularity is pretty solidified. Over the course of centuries, pasta&#x2019;s texture, appearance and uses have evolved and grown to the wide variety available today. Did you know that if you lined up all the spaghetti eaten by Americans each year, it could circle the Earth nine times? Even our founding fathers shared our modern love of pasta. Thomas Jefferson brought a pasta machine back with him from his time in Europe in 1789. And if you think that Americans love pasta (we consume 20 pounds of it per person each year), just think for a second about the fact that Italians consume three times that amount of pasta per person each year.</p> <h3> No Matter How You Enjoy Your Pasta, Domino&#x2019;s Has a Dish for You</h3> <p>Are you crazy about fettuccine Alfredo? Are you nuts about al dente penne pasta in a creamy garlic sauce? Do you go wild for hearty chicken Parmesan served on a bed of spaghetti?</p> <p>Domino&#x2019;s is more than just a pizza place. We have something for any pasta lover and all their dietary demands. Are you a Parmesan fanatic? Does marinara made with fresh, vine-ripened tomatoes makes you weak in the knees? If so, one of Domino&#x2019;s pasta dishes is sure to fit the bill.

Sitting atop pizza, contrasting with the creaminess of cheeses like mozzarella, Parmesan, and provolone, the meaty discs make mouths water. A blend of pork, beef, and spices, pepperoni&#x2019;s distinctive flavor holds its own when <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizzeria/">paired with robust tomato sauce</a> and other meats.</p> <p>And when you&#x2019;re looking for the best pepperoni pizza, look for the best <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-restaurant/">pizza restaurant</a>, and think Domino&#x2019;s. (Not that we&#x2019;re partial or anything.)</p> <h2>Pepperoni Is a Classic for a Reason</h2> <p>To honor pepperoni&#x2019;s top spot in the <a href="/en/about-pizza/online-pizza/">pizza universe</a>, we created the Ultimate Pepperoni pizza. Made with two layers of meat and 100 percent real mozzarella, Parmesan, Asiago, and provolone, this pizza is to pepperoni lovers what the library is to book lovers.</p> <p>Although meat and cheese is all some pizza enthusiasts need, others appreciate pepperoni&#x2019;s ability to enhance the flavor of additional toppings. Pepperoni and green olive pizza is a proven combination that delivers contrasting yet complementary flavors and textures.</p> <p>To highlight pepperoni&#x2019;s ability to play well with other toppings, we include it on our MeatZZa&trade; pizza with ham, Italian sausage, beef, and 100 percent real mozzarella. In fact, four of our Specialty Pizzas include pepperoni, a testament to the meat&#x2019;s easygoing personality.</p> <h3> Pepperoni Shakes Things Up</h3> <p>Pepperoni is also a winning match with pineapple, creating a sweet-and-savory combo heightened by our robust inspired tomato sauce. Or pair it with a trio of peppers &mdash; banana, green, and roasted red &mdash; for a similarly sweet result that increases the heat quotient. It also works well with even spicier toppings, like hot sauce and habaneros, a combination that demands attention.</p> <p>As the go-to pizza topping, pepperoni has long been a kids&#x2019; favorite. Use familiar, tried-and-true pepperoni pizza to introduce kids to <a href="/en/pages/order/menu.jsp#/menu/category/viewAll/">new flavors</a> such as green peppers, black olives, and mushrooms. You could also try surprising pizza lovers of all ages by pairing pepperoni with bacon and fresh onions.

Or add banana peppers to an Italian sausage pizza for a vinegary tang and jolt of color. Green peppers are vibrant on our Deluxe pizza, which includes pepperoni, Italian sausage, fresh mushrooms, fresh onions, and pizza cheese made with 100 percent real mozzarella cheese.</p> <p>We take advantage of the sweet nature of roasted red peppers by including them on our <a href="/en/about-pizza/about-menu/">Honolulu Hawaiian pizza</a>. They pair with tropical pineapple, offset the meatiness of ham and smoked bacon, and balance out the 100 percent real mozzarella and provolone cheeses.</p> <p>Go all in by creating a three-pepper pizza with banana peppers, green peppers, and roasted red peppers for layers of sweet and spicy flavors. Use roasted red peppers to coax out the subtle nutty flavor of Parmesan cheese, or pair jalape&ntilde;os with mild mozzarella to subdue some of the pepper&#x2019;s heat while elevating the creaminess of the cheese.</p> <p>When paired with meat on pizza, peppers know how to hold their own. Add green peppers to pizza with pepperoni for an additional layer of texture with a hint of sweetness. Add banana peppers to Italian sausage to highlight the meat&#x2019;s spice while contrasting it with the fruit&#x2019;s tang.</p> <h3>Some Like It Hot</h3> <p>For those who embrace spice, our Sweet Mango Habanero pepper sauce is a can&#x2019;t-miss. Pair it with jalape&ntilde;os for a double dose of fiery deliciousness offset by layers of mild, melted cheese. Jalape&ntilde;os paired with our Philly-style steak and garlic Parmesan white sauce results in an unexpectedly delectable pizza with just enough kick.

Sure, you could pack a lunch in a brown paper bag, but a ham sandwich and an apple won&#x2019;t do a beautiful day justice. Call Domino&#x2019;s and order a hot <a href="/en/pages/order/#/section/Food/category/Sandwich/">Italian sandwich</a> with a Sprite, a Buffalo Chicken sandwich with a Fanta Orange, or a Mediterranean Veggie sandwich and a cold, refreshing Dasani water. Picnics are so much better when you don&#x2019;t have to prep your own meal!</p> <h2>Domino&#x2019;s Sandwiches and Picnics Go Together</h2> <p>Traditional picnics include a soft blanket, maybe a Frisbee, and a selection of sandwiches. There&#x2019;s no need to spend time in the kitchen when you can use Domino&#x2019;s as your catering service for picnics. Choose Domino&#x2019;s for a wide variety of oven-baked sandwiches, like our Chicken Bacon Ranch or Chicken Parm sandwich. Either way, you can swing by your closest Domino&#x2019;s or even <a href="/en/about-pizza/food-delivery/">get your meal delivered</a> to the park. We really can do all the heavy lifting for you.</p> <h3>Spice Up Your Picnics</h3> <p>Not everyone is a sandwich lover (say it isn&#x2019;t so!). As an alternative, when planning picnics on the beach or next to a lake, let us suggest Domino&#x2019;s pasta or <a href="/en/about-pizza/chicken-wings/">chicken wings</a>. You can build your own pasta perfection or order our Pasta Primavera. If you prefer a little spice in your life, order our Classic Hot Buffalo chicken or Spicy Jalape&ntilde;o- Pineapple Specialty Chicken. With Domino&#x2019;s, picnics can be more than just a sandwich in the park.</p> <h4>A Romantic Date With Domino&#x2019;s</h4> <p>For your more romantic picnics, the kicker is getting the right dessert. Sure, candles and a bottle of wine are romantic. However, nothing says &ldquo;you&#x2019;re my favorite&rdquo; like chocolate, and Domino&#x2019;s has the perfect dessert for romantic picnics. Our Chocolate Lava Crunch Cakes have gooey chocolate fudge at the center of a warm chocolate cake, and it&#x2019;s good enough to make picnics a go-to date night option &mdash; and to make your date swoon.</p> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- SET SOCIAL --\x3e <div id="deals"> <div id="news"> <div id="reviews"></div> </div> <div id="local"> <div id="signup"></div> <div id="sitemap"> <a href="'+f(a.lambda(null!=b?b.ctx:b,b))+'/about-pizza/sitemap/">Sitemap</a> </div> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- END SOCIAL --\x3e <div class="clear"></div> </div> </div> </div> \x3c!-- END MAIN --\x3e </div> \x3c!-- END PAGE --\x3e </div> '},useData:!0}),this.overrides.pineapple=a.template({compiler:[7,">= 4.0.0"],main:function(a,b,c,d,e){var f=a.escapeExpression;return'<div id="coupons"> \x3c!-- SET PAGE --\x3e <div id="delivery"> \x3c!-- SET MAIN --\x3e <div id="order"> <div class="locations"> <div class="pizza"> '+f(c.prt.call(null!=b?b:a.nullContext||{},"aboutPizzaPageOrder",{name:"prt",hash:{},data:e}))+' <div id="online" class="head"> <div class="dominos"> <h1>What&#x2019;s on a Hawaiian Pineapple Pizza From Domino&#x2019;s?</h1> <p>We make the original Hawaiian pizza even better in our <a href="../../../../about-pizza/about-menu/">Honolulu Hawaiian pizza</a>, which features traditional ham and pineapple as well as smoked bacon, roasted red peppers, mozzarella, and provolone cheese. With a balance of sweet and tart, pineapple is a great mate for anything spicy and robust, like our Fiery Hawaiian pizza, which calls on the sweetness of pineapple to counterbalance the spice of hot sauce and jalape&ntilde;os.</p> <h2>Pineapple Takes Pizza From Good to Great</h2> <p>Pineapple on pizza isn&#x2019;t an on-the-fence proposition: People either love it or they don&#x2019;t. If it&#x2019;s possible for <a href="../../../../about-pizza/">pizza</a> to be divisive, pineapple makes it so, creating rifts in the most harmonious of families and making enemies into friends. The debate started more than 50 years ago, when a man named Sam created the Hawaiian pizza in Chatham, Ontario. For a lot of people, the resulting combination of tomato sauce, cheese, ham, and pineapple was flavor nirvana. If pineapple isn&#x2019;t your thing, don&#x2019;t worry about turning friends to foe over your favorite slice. Domino&#x2019;s allows you to customize your order to make it great for everyone. Stop by our <a href="../../../../about-pizza/pizza-restaurant/">pizza restaurant</a> or check out our app to find out how to get the best of both worlds.</p> <h3>Pineapple and Pizza: Opposites Attract</h3> <p>Onion lovers will appreciate the addition of pineapple on pizza for its sweet and tart effect, as pineapple&#x2019;s acidity dovetails with the fruit aspects of onion. A Hawaiian burger is replicated in pizza form with delicious results by adding pineapple to our <a href="../../../../about-pizza/">Bacon Cheeseburger Feast<sup>&reg;</sup> pizza</a>. Pineapple is also commonly served with barbecued meats in Polynesian cuisine. Add pineapple to Italian sausage on pizza, or try pineapple on our Memphis BBQ chicken pizza for a bright addition that highlights the magic behind the marriage of tart and sweet.</p> <h4>Weird Science</h4> <p>For the truly adventurous, pineapple has been found to pair well with blue cheese, based on both foods&#x2019; aroma profile &mdash; a sciencey way to determine food pairings. Order a side of our blue cheese sauce to test this theory on your next pineapple-loaded pizza. According to this same science, the rose aroma of pineapple links pineapple to tomato, which may explain why it works so well with tomato sauce.</a> <p>Whether it&#x2019;s thanks to science, the yin and yang of sweet and tart, a unique alignment of constellations, or a combination of all of the above, one thing is clear: We think pineapple on pizza works.</p> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- SET SOCIAL --\x3e <div id="deals"> <div id="news"> <div id="reviews"></div> </div> <div id="local"> <div id="signup"></div> <div id="sitemap"> <a href="'+f(a.lambda(null!=b?b.ctx:b,b))+'/about-pizza/sitemap/">Sitemap</a> </div> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- END SOCIAL --\x3e <div class="clear"></div> </div> </div> </div> \x3c!-- END MAIN --\x3e </div> \x3c!-- END PAGE --\x3e </div> '},useData:!0}),this.overrides.pizzaaroundme=a.template({compiler:[7,">= 4.0.0"],main:function(a,b,c,d,e){var f=a.escapeExpression;return'<div id="coupons"> \x3c!-- SET PAGE --\x3e <div id="delivery"> \x3c!-- SET MAIN --\x3e <div id="order"> <div class="locations"> <div class="pizza"> '+f(c.prt.call(null!=b?b:a.nullContext||{},"aboutPizzaPageOrder",{name:"prt",hash:{},data:e}))+' <div id="online" class="head"> <div class="dominos"> <h1>What&#x2019;s the Best Place for Pizza Around Me?</h1> <p>When you&#x2019;re feeling hungry, you start to wonder where you can find the perfect <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizzeria/">pizzeria</a>.

The pizza crust, of course! And Domino&#x2019;s <a href="../pizza-restaurant/">Pizza restaurants</a> have five to choose from. <h2>Handmade Pan Pizza Crust</h2> <p>One thing Domino&#x2019;s customers can&#x2019;t get enough of is our Handmade Pan pizza. All of our Handmade Pan pizzas are made from fresh, never frozen dough that&#x2019;s hand-pressed into the pan with care to create a wonderfully scrumptious thick crust. Made to order with your choice of meats, cheeses, and toppings, the Handmade Pan pizza is baked to perfection so that the crust comes out thick, crispy, and delectable, with a golden brown color.</p> <h3>Hand Tossed Pizza Crust</h3> <p>Each Hand Tossed pizza is prepared by a pro dedicated to creating the perfect pie made to your preferences. The Hand Tossed pizza has a fluffy crust that&#x2019;s thinner than the Handmade Pan, but thicker than the Crunchy Thin. Hand Tossed crust dough is kneaded, and stretched until to size. Once it&#x2019;s cooked, this crust is accented with a garlic season blend and topped with your favorite meats, cheeses, and veggies.</p> <h4>Crunchy Thin Pizza Crust</h4> <p>If you like your crust crispy, then you&#x2019;ll love the Crunchy Thin crust. This pizza is the thinnest of the bunch, and will hold all of your favorite toppings. For those who think less is more, this is for you.</p> <h5>Brooklyn Style Pizza Crust</h5> <p>If you&#x2019;ve got a big crowd &mdash; or a big appetite &mdash; then the Brooklyn Style will be just right. Each Brooklyn Style pizza is cut into six big triangles, so you can fold each slice and eat it like a true New Yorker.</p> <h6>Gluten Free Pizza Crust</h6> <p>For customers who have decided to live without gluten, we have just the thing: The Gluten Free Crust is designed for people who have a sensitivity to gluten.

Through the decades, we have grown to more than 5,200 U.S. pizza restaurants. It&#x2019;s a trip that took 55 years, but it was worth it! <h2>A Pizza Restaurant by Any Other Name</h2> Back when we started in 1960, Domino&#x2019;s was called DomiNick&#x2019;s. Brothers Tom and James Monaghan bought the Ypsilanti, Michigan, pizza restaurant for $500. It wasn&#x2019;t until 1965 that Tom renamed the restaurant Domino&#x2019;s Pizza. <h3>Our Pizza Restaurant History</h3> After the 1965 renaming, franchise pizza restaurants began to open &mdash; one in 1967 and another in 1968. In the next 10 years, Domino&#x2019;s opened 200 more locations. Our growth really took off after that, with Domino&#x2019;s becoming the fastest-growing pizza restaurant in the United States in 1985. Just 11 years later, in 1996, we launched this website. Since then, we have continued to launch new pizza restaurants while innovating online and off. <h4>Not Just Pizza Restaurants Anymore</h4> In 2008, Domino&#x2019;s became one of the world&#x2019;s largest sandwich delivery restaurants overnight, when we launched our line of toasty Oven Baked Sandwiches. In 2009, we added penne pasta and Chocolate Lava Crunch Cake to the menu. In 2010, Domino&#x2019;s rolled out an entirely new <a href="../">pizza</a> recipe, including new sauce, crust, and cheese. In 2011, Domino&#x2019;s continued to revamp its <a href="../about-menu/">menu</a>, launching a new recipe for wings and boneless chicken and adding two new bread sides &mdash; Stuffed Cheesy Bread and Parmesan Bread Bites. Also, to stay true to our roots, we expanded the pizza menu, with Domino&#x2019;s American Legends<sup>&reg;</sup> pizzas using premium ingredients. And the menu got a little sweeter in 2015, with the addition of the Marbled Cookie Brownie. </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- SET SOCIAL --\x3e <div id="deals"> <div id="news"> <div id="reviews"></div> </div> <div id="local"> <div id="signup"></div> <div id="sitemap"> <a href="'+f(a.lambda(null!=b?b.ctx:b,b))+'/about-pizza/sitemap/">Sitemap</a> </div> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- END SOCIAL --\x3e <div class="clear"></div> </div> </div> </div> \x3c!-- END MAIN --\x3e </div> \x3c!-- END PAGE --\x3e </div> '},useData:!0}),this.overrides.pizzasauce=a.template({compiler:[7,">= 4.0.0"],main:function(a,b,c,d,e){var f=a.escapeExpression;return'<div id="coupons"> \x3c!-- SET PAGE --\x3e <div id="delivery"> \x3c!-- SET MAIN --\x3e <div id="order"> <div class="locations"> <div class="pizza"> '+f(c.prt.call(null!=b?b:a.nullContext||{},"aboutPizzaPageOrder",{name:"prt",hash:{},data:e}))+' <div id="online" class="head"> <div class="dominos"> <h1>What Are Domino&#x2019;s Pizza Sauce Options?</h1> <p>Pizza lovers will agree that the secret to the ultimate pizza experience is the perfect pizza sauce.

These tomatoes make the most delicious sauces, which is why every Domino&#x2019;s pizza has a consistently flavorful taste.</p> <p>The traditional pizza sauce for most Domino&#x2019;s <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-restaurant/">pizza restaurant</a> pies is the Robust Inspired pizza sauce, a thick, zesty flavor redolent with garlic and other special spices. If you prefer less spicy sauces, opt for the Hearty Marinara sauce. Those who like a home-cooked, smoky taste, should try topping their crust with Domino&#x2019;s BBQ sauce. Or, if you have a penchant for creamier sauces, we recommend garlic Parmesan white sauce or Alfredo sauce.</p> <p>No matter which taste you prefer, Domino&#x2019;s <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-places/">pizza place</a> makes it easy to create the perfect meal every time.</p> <h2>Extra Sauces, Please!</h2> <p>Whether you go with our <a href="/en/pages/order/#/section/Food/category/AllEntrees/">Build Your Own Pizza or</a> <a href="/en/pages/order/#/section/Food/category/Pasta/">Build Your Own Pasta</a> options or select one of our Specialty Pizzas, you have your choice of type and amount of pizza sauce.

Since its introduction to the culinary world in Manhattan in the 1970s, Pasta Primavera has quickly become one of the most popular pasta dishes in the country today.</p> <p>Domino&#x2019;s has Pasta Primavera, and when you order it from us, you get all the deliciousness with none of the hassle of cooking. We start with tender but perfectly cooked penne pasta. After slowly saut&eacute;ing fresh baby spinach, diced tomatoes, mushrooms and onions, we combine the veggies with the pasta and Domino&#x2019;s signature creamy Alfredo sauce. Our Alfredo sauce is rich but never overwhelming, allowing the delicate freshness of the baby spinach and diced tomatoes to shine through.</p> <h2> Pasta Primavera: a Marriage of Flavor and Freshness</h2> <p>Domino&#x2019;s exclusive Pasta Primavera recipe uses only the freshest vegetables and carefully blends them with an olive oil, garlic and herb-based creamy Alfredo sauce. When creating the recipe for our Pasta Primavera, the chefs in our test kitchen worked tirelessly to create a dish that reflected our long-standing love of ripe tomatoes, picked at the peak of their flavor, and the green, leafy goodness of baby spinach. After much experimentation, they perfected a Pasta Primavera recipe that is equal parts hearty and light, especially when baked into the goodness of our Domino&#x2019;s pasta bread bowls.</p> <h3> Make Date Night a Pasta Primavera Kind of Night</h3> <p>Got a special someone that you want to impress, but you want pizza and they want something different?

Most people love it, and there&#x2019;s a good number who pair it with a variety of meals. Some would argue that the best pairing is with <a href="/en/pages/order/#/section/Food/category/Wings/">chicken wings</a>, while others claim it&#x2019;s pizza. Some prefer it drizzled on top of their meal, while others dunk their crusts into it. Needless to say, all are delicious options, and Domino&#x2019;s has ranch to satisfy even the biggest fan. Make sure there&#x2019;s plenty to go around by adding a few extra dipping cups to your online order.</p> <h2>Domino&#x2019;s Ranch Dressing Is Delish</h2> <p>Ranch livens up a meal with its creamy, tangy taste with a hint of black pepper and herbs. Domino&#x2019;s took this flavor into consideration when we created the Cali Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza. Working with the juicy chicken and crispy bacon, ranch adds zest to accentuate the flavors of the entire pizza. Order the dipping sauce on the side and enjoy the garlic butter crust dipped in the same creamy ranch. This same pizza is also available in <a href="/en/pages/order/#/section/Food/category/Sandwich/">sandwich</a> form. The Chicken Bacon Ranch sandwich is the warm, toasty sandwich everyone craves at <a href="/en/about-pizza/occasions/picnics">picnics</a>, <a href="/en/about-pizza/occasions/office-parties">office parties</a>, or for a night in watching reality TV.</p> <h3>Dip Everything in Ranch</h3> <p>Ranch is a great way to tone down spiciness without ruining the taste of the hot Buffalo sauce. This is a great dish for sports parties or birthdays. If you&#x2019;re not a fan of spicy foods, try dipping the Crispy Bacon &amp; Tomato Specialty Chicken in ranch, or drizzle it on top for a more subtle addition. Things might get messy with these chicken options, so be sure to have napkins on hand. Trust us. The combination of Buffalo and ranch on your fingers is well worth it.</p> <h4>Choose Domino&#x2019;s for Delivery</h4> <p>Domino&#x2019;s is your one-stop <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-places/">pizza place</a> when it comes to cravings big or small.

Part sweet, part savory, with a whisper of spice, they are a staple of Mediterranean cooking and are often included on antipasto platters with bread, olives, cheeses and meats. Take inspiration from cooks across the globe and pair them with a wide variety of other <a href="/en/pages/order/menu.jsp#/menu/category/viewAll/">pizza toppings</a> from Domino&#x2019;s to create vibrant flavor combinations. No matter what your combination preference, this <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-places/">pizza place</a> has got you covered.</p> <h2>Roasted Red Peppers Are a Sweet Treat on Pizza</h2> <p>Roasted red peppers are preserved with salt, sugar, and acid, which gives them a pleasant tang with underlying layers of smoke and charred flavors, shot through with very subtle spice. Overarching these flavors, however, is the peppers&#x2019; sweetness, which is highlighted by the roasting and brining processes. We take advantage of the sweet nature of the peppers by including them on our Honolulu Hawaiian pizza, where they pair well with pineapple, offset the meatiness of ham and smoked bacon, and perfectly balance 100 percent real mozzarella and provolone cheeses.</p> <p>Roasted red peppers provide a slight, smoldering spice to the vibrant, fresh flavors of our Pacific Veggie pizza, with baby spinach, onions, mushrooms, diced tomatoes, black olives, and a blend of mozzarella and provolone cheeses sprinkled with garlic herb seasoning on a <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-crust/">Parmesan-Asiago crust</a>.</p> <h3>Subtle Sophistication With Roasted Red Peppers</h3> <p>Because of their faint charred flavor, roasted red peppers pair well with meats, such as our premium chicken, beef, and Philly steak. Create a pizza reminiscent of shish kabobs by pairing the peppers with chicken, green peppers, mushrooms, onions, and diced tomatoes. Conjure the flavors of a rich pasta dish by combining our Alfredo sauce with the peppers and a host of additional toppings, from chicken to beef, to onions and mushrooms. Although <a href="/en/about-pizza/philly-cheese-steak/">Philly cheese steak</a> purists may take offense, the peppers are a kicky addition to the pizza inspired by the classic sandwich, which includes tender slices of steak, fresh onions, green peppers, and mushrooms with provolone and American cheeses on a <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-crust/">cheesy provolone crust</a>.</p> <p>When paired with spicy meats like pepperoni and Italian sausage, the subtle heat of roasted red peppers emerges to delicious effect. Try the peppers on a classic pepperoni pizza or add them to a pizza with Italian sausage and black olives, which results in a multicolored feast for the eyes. In fact, their cheery red color should not be underestimated. On a simple cheese pizza, for instance, scarlet peppers provide commas of color that hint at the sweet smokiness that awaits.</p> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- SET SOCIAL --\x3e <div id="deals"> <div id="news"> <div id="reviews"></div> </div> <div id="local"> <div id="signup"></div> <div id="sitemap"> <a href="'+f(a.lambda(null!=b?b.ctx:b,b))+'/about-pizza/sitemap/">Sitemap</a> </div> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- END SOCIAL --\x3e <div class="clear"></div> </div> </div> </div> \x3c!-- END MAIN --\x3e </div> \x3c!-- END PAGE --\x3e </div> '},useData:!0}),this.overrides.salad=a.template({compiler:[7,">= 4.0.0"],main:function(a,b,c,d,e){var f=a.escapeExpression;return'<div id="coupons"> \x3c!-- SET PAGE --\x3e <div id="delivery"> \x3c!-- SET MAIN --\x3e <div id="order"> <div class="locations"> <div class="pizza"> '+f(c.prt.call(null!=b?b:a.nullContext||{},"aboutPizzaPageOrder",{name:"prt",hash:{},data:e}))+' <div id="online" class="head"> <div class="dominos"> <h1>Does Domino&#x2019;s Sell Salad?</h1> <p>Good news for those who love greens! Domino&#x2019;s has three delicious salads to choose from, plus three salad dressing options:</p> <ul> <li>Classic Garden Salad: Crisp and colorful. Grape tomatoes, red onion, carrots, red cabbage, cheddar cheese, brioche garlic croutons, and romaine and iceberg lettuces.</li> <li>Chicken Caesar Salad: Rich and delicious. Roasted white meat chicken, Parmesan cheese, brioche garlic croutons, and romaine and iceberg lettuces.</li> <li>Chicken Apple Pecan Salad: A little sweet. Roasted white meat chicken, diced red and green apples, dried cranberries, praline pecans, cheddar cheese, and leafy spring mix.</li> </ul> <p>Salad dressing options include creamy ranch, tangy Caesar (contains anchovy), and balsamic vinaigrette. When you&#x2019;re looking for salad <a href="/en/about-pizza/occasions/delivery-near-me/">delivery near me</a>, Domino&#x2019;s is the answer.</p> <h2>The History of Salad</h2> <p>Pizza and salad might seem like the ideal match, because they&#x2019;ve been paired together at Domino&#x2019;s for decades. But did you know that the history of salad dates back to the ancient Greek and Romans?</p> <p>Salads began very simply, with mixed greens and dressing. It was a little like our own Classic Garden Salad, minus all the delicious toppings.</p> <p>Salads got more complex with time. The dinner salad as we know it dates to the Renaissance period. We like to think of our Chicken Apple Pecan salad as our contribution to salad innovation.</p> <h3>Ordering Salad From Domino&#x2019;s</h3> <p>It&#x2019;s easy to find salad near me when Domino&#x2019;s has so many convenient nearby locations. Order online by choosing <a href="/en/about-pizza/food-delivery/">delivery</a> or carryout. Then select which salad option you prefer. Don&#x2019;t forget to choose your salad dressing!</p> <p>Domino&#x2019;s salads are tasty complements to any of our Specialty Pizzas, Oven Baked Sandwiches, or Penne <a href="/en/about-pizza/other-foods/dominos/pasta/">Pastas</a>.

Where pepperoni offers heft and name recognition, salami is sleek and refined. When included on pizza, it has the ability to transport your taste buds to Italy.</p> <p>At Domino&#x2019;s <a href="../../../pizza-restaurant/">Pizza restaurants</a>, you can add salami to any pizza you&#x2019;d like. Hearty marinara sauce with salami and diced tomatoes topped with mozzarella cheese is a simple yet impressive combination. Like its more forceful brother, pepperoni, salami also pairs well with green olives. The fruit&#x2019;s brine enhances the meat&#x2019;s earthiness while, in turn, salami matches the olives&#x2019; meaty texture.</p> <h2>Salami Adds a Tasty Kick to Sandwiches</h2> <p>Salami doesn&#x2019;t just taste great on pizza. Domino&#x2019;s is the pizza place that pays homage to the <a href="../../../lunch-ideas/">Italian sandwich</a> and salami&#x2019;s heritage. We stack pepperoni, salami, and ham topped with banana peppers, fresh green peppers, fresh onions, and provolone cheese on bread baked to a perfect golden brown.</p> <h3>Build Your Own Salami Pizza</h3> <p>Why not surprise gourmand guests with a pizza that pairs the meat with a mix of cheeses and our garlic Parmesan white sauce? And the meat can stand some heat. Go bold by creating a spicy salami pizza with our Sweet Mango Habanero sauce and jalape&ntilde;os. Plenty of melted cheese subdues the heat, while the meat&#x2019;s texture pairs well with the lushness of the peppers.</p> <p>Another luscious pairing is salami and roasted red peppers. The meat plays off the sweetness of the peppers, while the ingredients share smoky undertones and weighty, robust texture.</p> <p>The bright, lively color of the meat can also perk up traditionally vegetarian options, like the Pacific Veggie, as well as those made with our rich, creamy Alfredo sauce. The addition of salami transforms <a href="../../../../pages/order/menu.jsp#/menu/category/viewAll/">Domino&#x2019;s Spinach &amp; Feta pizza</a> from vegetarian feast to hearty meal. Mild enough to stay out of the way of the other flavors, salami balances spinach&#x2019;s slightly bitter taste and anchors tangy feta.</p> <p>Keep pairings simple for pizzas that are sure to please.</p> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- SET SOCIAL --\x3e <div id="deals"> <div id="news"> <div id="reviews"></div> </div> <div id="local"> <div id="signup"></div> <div id="sitemap"> <a href="'+f(a.lambda(null!=b?b.ctx:b,b))+'/about-pizza/sitemap/">Sitemap</a> </div> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- END SOCIAL --\x3e <div class="clear"></div> </div> </div> </div> \x3c!-- END MAIN --\x3e </div> \x3c!-- END PAGE --\x3e </div> '},useData:!0}),this.overrides.sandwiches=a.template({compiler:[7,">= 4.0.0"],main:function(a,b,c,d,e){var f=a.escapeExpression;return'<div id="coupons"> \x3c!-- SET PAGE --\x3e <div id="delivery"> \x3c!-- SET MAIN --\x3e <div id="order"> <div class="locations"> <div class="pizza"> '+f(c.prt.call(null!=b?b:a.nullContext||{},"aboutPizzaPageOrder",{name:"prt",hash:{},data:e}))+' <div id="online" class="head"> <div class="dominos"> <h1>Who Has the Best Sandwiches?</h1> <p>For years, Domino&#x2019;s pizza ovens were given only one task: cooking <a href="/en/about-pizza/">the tastiest pizzas</a> in the country.

More complex than lettuce and sweeter than mature spinach, our baby spinach adds depth, texture, and distinctive flavor to a <a href="../../../pizzeria/">variety of pizzas</a>, as well as Stuffed Cheesy Bread.</p> <p>Because of its woody earthiness, spinach is a great match to rich, creamy white sauces on pizza. Pair it with our garlic Parmesan white sauce, and top with Parmesan, mozzarella, and feta cheeses for a gourmet vegetarian pizza that pops with color.</p> <h2> Popeye Would Approve</h2> <p>Spinach is front and center on Domino&#x2019;s <a href="../../../pizza-restaurant/">Pizza restaurant&#x2019;s</a> Spinach &amp; Feta pizza, where the vegetable balances the tang of the feta cheese and its earthy flavor matches the nuttiness of Parmesan cheese. It also stars in our <a href="../../../vegetarian/">Pacific Veggie pizza</a>, which includes roasted red peppers, fresh onions, fresh mushrooms, diced tomatoes, black olives, and 100 percent real mozzarella, feta, and provolone cheeses. Like the conductor of an orchestra, spinach brings the other veggies together to create flavor harmony.</p> <h3> Pasta-Inspired Spinach Pizza</h3> <p>Domino&#x2019;s is the <a href="../../../pizza-places/">pizza place</a> that help you create a pizza inspired by a classic pasta dish by combining Alfredo sauce with spinach and diced tomatoes. Add spinach to an otherwise white pizza, with other toppings such as chicken, mushrooms, and garlic Parmesan white sauce, for a defiant burst of color and unexpected layer of texture.</p> <h4> Instant Pizza Upgrade</h4> <p>The addition of fresh baby spinach quickly elevates even the most humble of pizzas, transforming basic pepperoni and cheese from kids&#x2019; favorite to sophisticated, grown-up feast. Add it to Italian sausage pizza for delicious color, or include it on a fiery pizza that includes banana peppers for a fresh way to tame the spice. Like salad served at a summer get-together, spinach also pairs well with BBQ sauce. Add it to our Memphis BBQ chicken pizza for a leafy contrast to the chicken and sweet sauce.</p> <p>You can also create your own perfect pizza with spinach just the way you like it. The green perks up meat and veggie pizzas alike with its verdant color and complex flavor.</p> <h5> More Spinach Options at Domino&#x2019;s</h5> <p>Spinach doesn&#x2019;t have to be confined to pizza. Domino&#x2019;s <a href="../../../pizza-restaurant/">Pizza restaurant\'s</a> <a href="../../../lunch-ideas/">Mediterranean Veggie sandwich</a> combines fresh baby spinach, roasted red peppers, banana peppers, diced tomatoes, fresh onions, and feta, provolone, and American cheeses on bread baked to a perfect golden brown. You can also choose to add it to our Chicken Parm sandwich, which includes grilled chicken breast, tomato basil marinara, and Parmesan, Asiago, and provolone cheeses for a refreshing tang. And you don&#x2019;t have to stop there. It can be a delicious addition to your favorite Domino&#x2019;s Oven Baked Sandwich&trade;.</p> </div> \x3c!-- SET SOCIAL --\x3e <div id="deals"> <div id="news"> <div id="reviews"></div> </div> <div id="local"> <div id="signup"></div> <div id="sitemap"> <a href="'+f(a.lambda(null!=b?b.ctx:b,b))+'/about-pizza/sitemap/">Sitemap</a> </div> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> \x3c!-- END SOCIAL --\x3e <div class="clear"></div> </div> </div> </div> \x3c!-- END MAIN --\x3e </div> \x3c!-- END PAGE --\x3e </div> '},useData:!0}),this.overrides["survey-opt-out"]=a.template({compiler:[7,">= 4.0.0"],main:function(a,b,c,d,e){var f=null!=b?b:a.nullContext||{},g=a.escapeExpression,h=a.lambda;return'<div class="grid js-customerEmailUnsubscribe"> <h1 class="pageHeading center optout--header grid__cell--1">'+g(c.t.call(f,"forms.sorry_to_see_you_go",{name:"t",hash:{},data:e}))+"<br>"+g(c.t.call(f,"forms.click_unsubscribe",{name:"t",hash:{},data:e}))+'</h1> <form class="grid__cell--1 optout-form"> <div> <h3 labelFor="Email" class="optout--header grid__cell--1/2 grid__cell--offset-1/8">'+g(c.t.call(f,"forms.email_address",{name:"t",hash:{},data:e}))+'</h3><br> <input value="'+g(h(null!=b?b.email:b,b))+'" name="Email" aria-label="Email" class="optout--input grid__cell--1/2 grid__cell--offset-1/4@desktop grid__cell--offset-1/8 js-email"> </div> <h3 labelFor="subPreference" class="optout--header grid__cell--3/4 grid__cell--offset-1/8">'+g(c.t.call(f,"forms.subscription_preference",{name:"t",hash:{},data:e}))+'</h3> <div aria-role="radiogroup" class="grid__cell--offset-1/4@desktop grid__cell--offset-1/8 grid__cell--3/4 optout-radiogroup"> <label labelFor="noSurveys"><input name="optOut" aria-label="'+g(c.t.call(f,"forms.no_surveys",{name:"t",hash:{},data:e}))+'" type="radio" value="noSurveys" checked>'+g(c.t.call(f,"forms.no_surveys",{name:"t",hash:{},data:e}))+'</label><br> <label labelFor="NoOffers"><input name="optOut" aria-label="'+g(c.t.call(f,"forms.no_offers",{name:"t",hash:{},data:e}))+'" type="radio" value="noOffers">'+g(c.t.call(f,"forms.no_offers",{name:"t",hash:{},data:e}))+'</label><br> <label labelFor="noSurveysOrOffers"><input name="optOut" aria-label="'+g(c.t.call(f,"forms.no_surveys_or_offers",{name:"t",hash:{},data:e}))+'" type="radio" value="noSurveysOrOffers">'+g(c.t.call(f,"forms.no_surveys_or_offers",{name:"t",hash:{},data:e}))+'</label><br> </div> <button class="grid__cell--offset-2/5@desktop grid__cell--offset-1/4 optout--button" type="submit">'+g(c.t.call(f,"forms.unsubscribe",{name:"t",hash:{},data:e}))+'</button><br> </form> <a href="'+g(h(null!=b?b.ctx:b,b))+'/" class="optout-homepage-link grid__cell--1">'+g(c.t.call(f,"forms.or_go_to_homepage",{name:"t",hash:{},data:e}))+'</a> </div> <div class="js-customerUnsubscribed grid is-hidden"> <h2 class="pageHeading optout--header center grid__cell--1">'+g(c.t.call(f,"forms.unsubscribe_requested",{name:"t",hash:{},data:e}))+'</h2> <a href="'+g(h(null!=b?b.ctx:b,b))+'/" class="grid__cell--offset-1/3"> <button type="button">'+g(c.t.call(f,"forms.go_to_homepage",{name:"t",hash:{},data:e}))+"</button> </a> </div>"},useData:!0}),this.overrides.takeoutnearme=a.template({compiler:[7,">= 4.0.0"],main:function(a,b,c,d,e){var f=a.escapeExpression;return'<div id="coupons"> \x3c!-- SET PAGE --\x3e <div id="delivery"> \x3c!-- SET MAIN --\x3e <div id="order"> <div class="locations"> <div class="pizza"> '+f(c.prt.call(null!=b?b:a.nullContext||{},"aboutPizzaPageOrder",{name:"prt",hash:{},data:e}))+' <div id="online" class="head"> <div class="dominos"> <h1>Where Can I Find Take Out Near Me?</h1> <p>Domino&#x2019;s offers endless options for take out near me.

Either way, Mom will be proud to see that you&#x2019;re eating more vegetables.</p> <h2>Please Vegetarians with Veggies-Only Pizza</h2> <p>When it comes to building <a href="/en/about-pizza/vegetarian/">veggie-only pizzas</a>, the options are limitless. For our Spinach and Feta pizza, we use baby spinach with onions and cheeses on a cheesy provolone crust. Our Pacific Veggie pizza combines baby spinach, roasted red peppers, onions, mushrooms, diced tomatoes, black olives, and cheeses.</p> <h3>Veggies Beef Up Meat Pizzas</h3> <p>Many of our Specialty Pizzas include veggies. Veggies bring fresh flavor to our <a href="/en/about-pizza/philly-cheese-steak/">Philly Cheese Steak pizza</a>, which features tender slices of steak paired with classic veggies –onions, green peppers and mushrooms &mdash; with provolone and American cheeses on a cheesy provolone crust. Veggies round out the flavors of meat, like on our ExtravaganZZa pizza, which pairs onions, green peppers, mushrooms and black olives with loads of pepperoni, ham, Italian sausage, beef and mozzarella cheese. </p> <p>Veggies add bursts of color to pizzas like our Deluxe Pizza, where green peppers, mushrooms and onions mingle with the spice of pepperoni and Italian sausage. Pair veggies with our Alfredo sauce for pizzas that bring to mind classic pasta dishes, like mushrooms and roasted red peppers.</p> <h4>Instant Classics</h4> <p>Veggies are an integral component to some of our most beloved pizzas, like pepperoni and black olives, Italian sausage and green peppers, ham and pineapple (okay, pineapple is technically a fruit). But you can also get creative; build your own veggies-only pizza, or add your favorite fresh veggies to your favorite meat pizza. For example, spinach is a great veggie to pair with meat toppings. Try spinach and Italian sausage for a vibrant pizza bursting with layers of texture and flavor.</p> <p>Including veggies on pizza is a great way to <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-party/">introduce kids to veggies</a>, like pepperoni with sweet roasted red peppers, or mild beef with earthy mushrooms. And it&#x2019;s easier than ever to personalize your veggie choices when you order online from Domino&#x2019;s <a href="/en/about-pizza/pizza-restaurant/">pizza restaurant</a>.

Our Address Verification Service (AVS) verifies the cardholder's billing zip code to help protect against fraud in card-not-present transactions. This additional security measure helps protect both you and Domino's against credit card fraud. AVS compares the submitted Zip code with the data on file at the cardholder's bank and returns a Yes/No answer. We can accept or reject orders based on this information.</p> <p><strong>Please Note:</strong> If you are using a debit card, and you enter the wrong billing zip code, your bank may place a &quot;funds hold&quot; on the amount you are attempting to charge. Each unsuccessful attempt will cause an additional &quot;funds hold.&quot; Depending on your bank's policy, it should release the &quot;funds hold&quot; in a few business days. Only a successful transaction will actually remove money from your account.</p> </div>"},useData:!0}),this.overrides});
